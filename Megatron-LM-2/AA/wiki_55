{"id": "6207", "revid": "3125232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6207", "title": "Electric current", "text": "Flow of electric charge\nAn electric current is a flow of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, moving through an electrical conductor or space. It is defined as the net rate of flow of electric charge through a surface. The moving particles are called charge carriers, which may be one of several types of particles, depending on the conductor. In electric circuits the charge carriers are often electrons moving through a wire. In semiconductors they can be electrons or holes. In an electrolyte the charge carriers are ions, while in plasma, an ionized gas, they are ions and electrons.\nThe SI unit of electric current is the ampere, or \"amp\", which is the flow of electric charge across a surface at the rate of one coulomb per second. The ampere (symbol: A) is an SI base unit. Electric current is measured using a device called an ammeter.\nElectric currents create magnetic fields, which are used in motors, generators, inductors, and transformers. In ordinary conductors, they cause Joule heating, which creates light in incandescent light bulbs. Time-varying currents emit electromagnetic waves, which are used in telecommunications to broadcast information.\nSymbol.\nThe conventional symbol for current is \"I\", which originates from the French phrase , (current intensity). Current intensity is often referred to simply as \"current\". The \"I\" symbol was used by Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re, after whom the unit of electric current is named, in formulating Amp\u00e8re's force law (1820). The notation travelled from France to Great Britain, where it became standard, although at least one journal did not change from using \"C\" to \"I\" until 1896.\nConventions.\nThe conventional direction of current, also known as \"conventional current\", is arbitrarily defined as the direction in which positive charges flow. In a conductive material, the moving charged particles that constitute the electric current are called charge carriers. In metals, which make up the wires and other conductors in most electrical circuits, the positively charged atomic nuclei of the atoms are held in a fixed position, and the negatively charged electrons are the charge carriers, free to move about in the metal. In other materials, notably the semiconductors, the charge carriers can be positive \"or\" negative, depending on the dopant used. Positive and negative charge carriers may even be present at the same time, as happens in an electrolyte in an electrochemical cell.\nA flow of positive charges gives the same electric current, and has the same effect in a circuit, as an equal flow of negative charges in the opposite direction. Since current can be the flow of either positive or negative charges, or both, a convention is needed for the direction of current that is independent of the type of charge carriers. Negatively charged carriers, such as the electrons (the charge carriers in metal wires and many other electronic circuit components), therefore flow in the opposite direction of conventional current flow in an electrical circuit.\nReference direction.\nA current in a wire or circuit element can flow in either of two directions. When defining a variable formula_1 to represent the current, the direction representing positive current must be specified, usually by an arrow on the circuit schematic diagram. This is called the \"reference direction\" of the current formula_1. When analyzing electrical circuits, the actual direction of current through a specific circuit element is usually unknown until the analysis is completed. Consequently, the reference directions of currents are often assigned arbitrarily. When the circuit is solved, a negative value for the current implies the actual direction of current through that circuit element is opposite that of the chosen reference direction.\nOhm's law.\nOhm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship:\nformula_3\nwhere \"I\" is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, \"V\" is the potential difference measured \"across\" the conductor in units of volts, and \"R\" is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms. More specifically, Ohm's law states that the \"R\" in this relation is constant, independent of the current.\nAlternating and direct current.\nIn alternating current (AC) systems, the movement of electric charge periodically reverses direction. AC is the form of electric power most commonly delivered to businesses and residences. The usual waveform of an AC power circuit is a sine wave, though certain applications use alternative waveforms, such as triangular or square waves. Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. An important goal in these applications is recovery of information encoded (or \"modulated\") onto the AC signal.\nIn contrast, direct current (DC) refers to a system in which the movement of electric charge in only one direction (sometimes called unidirectional flow). Direct current is produced by sources such as batteries, thermocouples, solar cells, and commutator-type electric machines of the dynamo type. Alternating current can also be converted to direct current through use of a rectifier. Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. An old name for direct current was \"galvanic current\".\nOccurrences.\nNatural observable examples of electric current include lightning, static electric discharge, and the solar wind, the source of the polar auroras.\nMan-made occurrences of electric current include the flow of conduction electrons in metal wires such as the overhead power lines that deliver electrical energy across long distances and the smaller wires within electrical and electronic equipment. Eddy currents are electric currents that occur in conductors exposed to changing magnetic fields. Similarly, electric currents occur, particularly in the surface, of conductors exposed to electromagnetic waves. When oscillating electric currents flow at the correct voltages within radio antennas, radio waves are generated.\nIn electronics, other forms of electric current include the flow of electrons through resistors or through the vacuum in a vacuum tube, the flow of ions inside a battery, and the flow of holes within metals and semiconductors. \nA biological example of current is the flow of ions in neurons and nerves, responsible for both thought and sensory perception.\nMeasurement.\nCurrent can be measured using an ammeter.\nElectric current can be directly measured with a galvanometer, but this method involves breaking the electrical circuit, which is sometimes inconvenient. \nCurrent can also be measured without breaking the circuit by detecting the magnetic field associated with the current. \nDevices, at the circuit level, use various techniques to measure current:\nResistive heating.\nJoule heating, also known as \"ohmic heating\" and \"resistive heating\", is the process of power dissipation by which the passage of an electric current through a conductor increases the internal energy of the conductor, converting thermodynamic work into heat. The phenomenon was first studied by James Prescott Joule in 1841. Joule immersed a length of wire in a fixed mass of water and measured the temperature rise due to a known current through the wire for a 30 minute period. By varying the current and the length of the wire he deduced that the heat produced was proportional to the square of the current multiplied by the electrical resistance of the wire.\nformula_4\nThis relationship is known as Joule's Law. The SI unit of energy was subsequently named the joule and given the symbol \"J\". The commonly known SI unit of power, the watt (symbol: W), is equivalent to one joule per second.\nElectromagnetism.\nElectromagnet.\nIn an electromagnet a coil of wires behaves like a magnet when an electric current flows through it. When the current is switched off, the coil loses its magnetism immediately.\nElectric current produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field can be visualized as a pattern of circular field lines surrounding the wire that persists as long as there is current.\nElectromagnetic induction.\nMagnetic fields can also be used to make electric currents. When a changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, an electromotive force (EMF) is induced, which starts an electric current, when there is a suitable path.\nRadio waves.\nWhen an electric current flows in a suitably shaped conductor at radio frequencies, radio waves can be generated. These travel at the speed of light and can cause electric currents in distant conductors.\nConduction mechanisms in various media.\nIn metallic solids, electric charge flows by means of electrons, from lower to higher electrical potential. In other media, any stream of charged objects (ions, for example) may constitute an electric current. To provide a definition of current independent of the type of charge carriers, \"conventional current\" is defined as moving in the same direction as the positive charge flow. So, in metals where the charge carriers (electrons) are negative, conventional current is in the opposite direction to the overall electron movement. In conductors where the charge carriers are positive, conventional current is in the same direction as the charge carriers.\nIn a vacuum, a beam of ions or electrons may be formed. In other conductive materials, the electric current is due to the flow of both positively and negatively charged particles at the same time. In still others, the current is entirely due to positive charge flow. For example, the electric currents in electrolytes are flows of positively and negatively charged ions. In a common lead-acid electrochemical cell, electric currents are composed of positive hydronium ions flowing in one direction, and negative sulfate ions flowing in the other. Electric currents in sparks or plasma are flows of electrons as well as positive and negative ions. In ice and in certain solid electrolytes, the electric current is entirely composed of flowing ions.\nMetals.\nIn a metal, some of the outer electrons in each atom are not bound to the individual molecules as they are in molecular solids, or in full bands as they are in insulating materials, but are free to move within the metal lattice. These conduction electrons can serve as charge carriers, carrying a current. Metals are particularly conductive because there are many of these free electrons. With no external electric field applied, these electrons move about randomly due to thermal energy but, on average, there is zero net current within the metal. At room temperature, the average speed of these random motions is 106 metres per second. Given a surface through which a metal wire passes, electrons move in both directions across the surface at an equal rate. As George Gamow wrote in his popular science book, \"One, Two, Three...Infinity\" (1947), \"The metallic substances differ from all other materials by the fact that the outer shells of their atoms are bound rather loosely, and often let one of their electrons go free. Thus the interior of a metal is filled up with a large number of unattached electrons that travel aimlessly around like a crowd of displaced persons. When a metal wire is subjected to electric force applied on its opposite ends, these free electrons rush in the direction of the force, thus forming what we call an electric current.\"\nWhen a metal wire is connected across the two terminals of a DC voltage source such as a battery, the source places an electric field across the conductor. The moment contact is made, the free electrons of the conductor are forced to drift toward the positive terminal under the influence of this field. The free electrons are therefore the charge carrier in a typical solid conductor.\nFor a steady flow of charge through a surface, the current \"I\" (in amperes) can be calculated with the following equation:\nformula_5\nwhere \"Q\" is the electric charge transferred through the surface over a time \"t\". If \"Q\" and \"t\" are measured in coulombs and seconds respectively, \"I\" is in amperes.\nMore generally, electric current can be represented as the rate at which charge flows through a given surface as:\nformula_6\nElectrolytes.\nElectric currents in electrolytes are flows of electrically charged particles (ions). For example, if an electric field is placed across a solution of Na+ and Cl\u2212 (and conditions are right) the sodium ions move towards the negative electrode (cathode), while the chloride ions move towards the positive electrode (anode). Reactions take place at both electrode surfaces, neutralizing each ion.\nWater-ice and certain solid electrolytes called proton conductors contain positive hydrogen ions (\"protons\") that are mobile. In these materials, electric currents are composed of moving protons, as opposed to the moving electrons in metals.\nIn certain electrolyte mixtures, brightly coloured ions are the moving electric charges. The slow progress of the colour makes the current visible.\nGases and plasmas.\nIn air and other ordinary gases below the breakdown field, the dominant source of electrical conduction is via relatively few mobile ions produced by radioactive gases, ultraviolet light, or cosmic rays. Since the electrical conductivity is low, gases are dielectrics or insulators. However, once the applied electric field approaches the breakdown value, free electrons become sufficiently accelerated by the electric field to create additional free electrons by colliding, and ionizing, neutral gas atoms or molecules in a process called avalanche breakdown. The breakdown process forms a plasma that contains enough mobile electrons and positive ions to make it an electrical conductor. In the process, it forms a light emitting conductive path, such as a spark, arc or lightning.\nPlasma is the state of matter where some of the electrons in a gas are stripped or \"ionized\" from their molecules or atoms. A plasma can be formed by high temperature, or by application of a high electric or alternating magnetic field as noted above. Due to their lower mass, the electrons in a plasma accelerate more quickly in response to an electric field than the heavier positive ions, and hence carry the bulk of the current. The free ions recombine to create new chemical compounds (for example, breaking atmospheric oxygen into single oxygen [O2 \u2192 2O], which then recombine creating ozone [O3]).\nVacuum.\nSince a \"perfect vacuum\" contains no charged particles, it normally behaves as a perfect insulator. However, metal electrode surfaces can cause a region of the vacuum to become conductive by injecting free electrons or ions through either field electron emission or thermionic emission. Thermionic emission occurs when the thermal energy exceeds the metal's work function, while field electron emission occurs when the electric field at the surface of the metal is high enough to cause tunneling, which results in the ejection of free electrons from the metal into the vacuum. Externally heated electrodes are often used to generate an electron cloud as in the filament or indirectly heated cathode of vacuum tubes. Cold electrodes can also spontaneously produce electron clouds via thermionic emission when small incandescent regions (called \"cathode spots\" or \"anode spots\") are formed. These are incandescent regions of the electrode surface that are created by a localized high current. These regions may be initiated by field electron emission, but are then sustained by localized thermionic emission once a vacuum arc forms. These small electron-emitting regions can form quite rapidly, even explosively, on a metal surface subjected to a high electrical field. Vacuum tubes and sprytrons are some of the electronic switching and amplifying devices based on vacuum conductivity.\nSuperconductivity.\nSuperconductivity is a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields occurring in certain materials when cooled below a characteristic critical temperature. It was discovered by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes on April\u00a08, 1911 in Leiden. Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon. It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of \"perfect conductivity\" in classical physics.\nSemiconductor.\nIn a semiconductor it is sometimes useful to think of the current as due to the flow of positive \"holes\" (the mobile positive charge carriers that are places where the semiconductor crystal is missing a valence electron). This is the case in a p-type semiconductor. A semiconductor has electrical conductivity intermediate in magnitude between that of a conductor and an insulator. This means a conductivity roughly in the range of 10\u22122 to 104 siemens per centimeter (S\u22c5cm\u22121).\nIn the classic crystalline semiconductors, electrons can have energies only within certain bands (i.e. ranges of levels of energy). Energetically, these bands are located between the energy of the ground state, the state in which electrons are tightly bound to the atomic nuclei of the material, and the free electron energy, the latter describing the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material. The energy bands each correspond to many discrete quantum states of the electrons, and most of the states with low energy (closer to the nucleus) are occupied, up to a particular band called the \"valence band\". Semiconductors and insulators are distinguished from metals because the valence band in any given metal is nearly filled with electrons under usual operating conditions, while very few (semiconductor) or virtually none (insulator) of them are available in the \"conduction band\", the band immediately above the valence band.\nThe ease of exciting electrons in the semiconductor from the valence band to the conduction band depends on the band gap between the bands. The size of this energy band gap serves as an arbitrary dividing line (roughly 4 eV) between semiconductors and insulators.\nWith covalent bonds, an electron moves by hopping to a neighboring bond. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that the electron be lifted into the higher anti-bonding state of that bond. For delocalized states, for example in one dimension\u00a0\u2013 that is in a nanowire, for every energy there is a state with electrons flowing in one direction and another state with the electrons flowing in the other. For a net current to flow, more states for one direction than for the other direction must be occupied. For this to occur, energy is required, as in the semiconductor the next higher states lie above the band gap. Often this is stated as: full bands do not contribute to the electrical conductivity. However, as a semiconductor's temperature rises above absolute zero, there is more energy in the semiconductor to spend on lattice vibration and on exciting electrons into the conduction band. The current-carrying electrons in the conduction band are known as \"free electrons\", though they are often simply called \"electrons\" if that is clear in context.\nCurrent density and Ohm's law.\nCurrent density is the rate at which charge passes through a chosen unit area. It is defined as a vector whose magnitude is the current per unit cross-sectional area. As discussed in Reference direction, the direction is arbitrary. Conventionally, if the moving charges are positive, then the current density has the same sign as the velocity of the charges. For negative charges, the sign of the current density is opposite to the velocity of the charges. In SI units, current density (symbol: j) is expressed in the SI base units of amperes per square metre.\nIn linear materials such as metals, and under low frequencies, the current density across the conductor surface is uniform. In such conditions, Ohm's law states that the current is directly proportional to the potential difference between two ends (across) of that metal (ideal) resistor (or other ohmic device):\nformula_7\nwhere formula_1 is the current, measured in amperes; formula_9 is the potential difference, measured in volts; and formula_10 is the resistance, measured in ohms. For alternating currents, especially at higher frequencies, skin effect causes the current to spread unevenly across the conductor cross-section, with higher density near the surface, thus increasing the apparent resistance.\nDrift speed.\nThe mobile charged particles within a conductor move constantly in random directions, like the particles of a gas. (More accurately, a Fermi gas.) To create a net flow of charge, the particles must also move together with an average drift rate. Electrons are the charge carriers in most metals and they follow an erratic path, bouncing from atom to atom, but generally drifting in the opposite direction of the electric field. The speed they drift at can be calculated from the equation:\nformula_11\nwhere\nTypically, electric charges in solids flow slowly. For example, in a copper wire of cross-section 0.5\u00a0mm2, carrying a current of 5\u00a0A, the drift velocity of the electrons is on the order of a millimetre per second. To take a different example, in the near-vacuum inside a cathode-ray tube, the electrons travel in near-straight lines at about a tenth of the speed of light.\nAny accelerating electric charge, and therefore any changing electric current, gives rise to an electromagnetic wave that propagates at very high speed outside the surface of the conductor. This speed is usually a significant fraction of the speed of light, as can be deduced from Maxwell's equations, and is therefore many times faster than the drift velocity of the electrons. For example, in AC power lines, the waves of electromagnetic energy propagate through the space between the wires, moving from a source to a distant load, even though the electrons in the wires only move back and forth over a tiny distance.\nThe ratio of the speed of the electromagnetic wave to the speed of light in free space is called the velocity factor, and depends on the electromagnetic properties of the conductor and the insulating materials surrounding it, and on their shape and size.\nThe magnitudes (not the natures) of these three velocities can be illustrated by an analogy with the three similar velocities associated with gases. (See also hydraulic analogy.)\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His father, David Ancillon (1617\u20131692), was obliged to leave France on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and became pastor of the French Protestant community in Berlin.\nAncillon studied law at Marburg, Geneva and Paris, where he was called to the bar. At the request of the Huguenots at Metz, he pleaded its cause at the court of King Louis XIV, urging that it should be excepted in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, but his efforts were unsuccessful, and he joined his father in Berlin. He was at once appointed by Elector Frederick III \"\"juge et directeur de colonie de Berlin\".\" He also became the first headmaster of Franz\u00f6sisches Gymnasium Berlin. Before this, he had published several works on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and its consequences, but his literary capacity was mediocre, his style stiff and cold, and it was his personal character rather than his reputation as a writer that earned him the confidence of the elector.\nIn 1687 Ancillon was appointed head of the so-called \"Academie des nobles,\" the principal educational establishment of the state; later on, as councillor of embassy, he took part in the negotiations which led to the assumption of the title of \"King in Prussia\" by the elector. In 1699 he succeeded Samuel Pufendorf as historiographer to the elector, and the same year replaced his uncle Joseph Ancillon as judge of all the French refugees in the Margraviate of Brandenburg.\nAncillon is mainly remembered for what he did for education in Brandenburg-Prussia, and the share he took, in co-operation with Gottfried Leibniz, in founding the Academy of Berlin. Of his fairly numerous works the one of the most value is the \"Histoire de l'etablissement des Francais refugies dans les etats de Brandebourg\" published in Berlin in 1690.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He achieved early local recognition, largely through the enthusiasm of George Sterling, for traditional verse in the vein of Swinburne. As a poet, Smith is grouped with the West Coast Romantics alongside Joaquin Miller, Sterling, and Nora May French and remembered as \"The Last of the Great Romantics\" and \"The Bard of Auburn\". Smith's work was praised by his contemporaries. H. P. Lovecraft stated that \"in sheer daemonic strangeness and fertility of conception, Clark Ashton Smith is perhaps unexcelled\", and Ray Bradbury said that Smith \"filled my mind with incredible worlds, impossibly beautiful cities, and still more fantastic creatures\".\nSmith was one of \"the big three of \"Weird Tales\", with Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft\", though some readers objected to his morbidness and violation of pulp traditions. The fantasy critic L. Sprague de Camp said of him that \"nobody since Poe has so loved a well-rotted corpse.\" Smith was a member of the Lovecraft circle, and his literary friendship with Lovecraft lasted from 1922 until Lovecraft's death in 1937. His work is marked by an extraordinarily rich and ornate vocabulary, a cosmic perspective and a vein of sardonic and sometimes ribald humor.\nOf his writing style, Smith stated: \"My own conscious ideal has been to delude the reader into accepting an impossibility, or series of impossibilities, by means of a sort of verbal black magic, in the achievement of which I make use of prose-rhythm, metaphor, simile, tone-color, counter-point, and other stylistic resources, like a sort of incantation.\"\nBiography.\nEarly life and education.\nSmith was born January 13, 1893, in Long Valley, Placer County, California, into a family of English and New England heritage. He spent most of his life in the small town of Auburn, California, living in a cabin built by his parents, Fanny and Timeus Smith. Smith professed to hate the town's provincialism but rarely left it until he married late in life.\nHis formal education was limited: he suffered from psychological disorders including intense agoraphobia, and although he was accepted to high school after attending eight years of grammar school, his parents decided it was better for him to be taught at home. An insatiable reader with an extraordinary eidetic memory, Smith appeared to retain most or all of whatever he read. After leaving formal education, he embarked upon a self-directed course of literature, including \"Robinson Crusoe\", \"Gulliver's Travels\", the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen and Madame d'Aulnoy, the \"Arabian Nights\" and the poems of Edgar Allan Poe. He read an unabridged dictionary word for word, studying not only the definitions of the words but also their etymology.\nThe other main course in Smith's self-education was to read the complete 11th edition of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" at least twice. Smith later taught himself French and Spanish to translate verse out of those languages, including works by G\u00e9rard de Nerval, Paul Verlaine, Amado Nervo, Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer and all but 6 of Charles Baudelaire's 157 poems in \"The Flowers of Evil\".\nEarly writing.\nHis first literary efforts, at the age of 11, took the form of fairy tales and imitations of the Arabian Nights. Later, he wrote long adventure novels dealing with Oriental life. By 14 he had already written a short adventure novel called \"The Black Diamonds\" which was lost for years until published in 2002. Another juvenile novel was written in his teenaged years: \"The Sword of Zagan\" (unpublished until 2004). Like \"The Black Diamonds\", it uses a medieval, \"Arabian Nights\"-like setting, and the \"Arabian Nights\", like the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and the works of Edgar Allan Poe, are known to have strongly influenced Smith's early writing, as did William Beckford's \"Vathek\".\nAt age 17, he sold several tales to \"The Black Cat\", a magazine which specialized in unusual tales. He also published some tales in the \"Overland Monthly\" in this brief foray into fiction which preceded his poetic career.\nHowever, it was primarily poetry that motivated the young Smith and he confined his efforts to poetry for more than a decade. In his later youth, Smith made the acquaintance of the San Francisco poet George Sterling through a member of the local Auburn Monday Night Club, where he read several of his poems with considerable success. On a month-long visit to Sterling in Carmel, California, Smith was introduced by Sterling to the poetry of Baudelaire.\nHe became Sterling's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and Sterling helped him to publish his first volume of poems, \"The Star-Treader and Other Poems\", at the age of 19. Smith received international acclaim for the collection. \"The Star-Treader\" was received very favorably by American critics, one of whom named Smith \"the Keats of the Pacific\". Smith briefly moved among the circle that included Ambrose Bierce and Jack London, but his early fame soon faded away.\nHealth breakdown period.\nA little later, Smith's health broke down and for eight years his literary production was intermittent, though he produced his best poetry during this period. A small volume, \"Odes and Sonnets\", was brought out in 1918. Smith came into contact with literary figures who would later form part of H.P. Lovecraft's circle of correspondents; Smith knew them far earlier than Lovecraft. These figures include poet Samuel Loveman and bookman George Kirk. It was Smith who in fact later introduced Donald Wandrei to Lovecraft. For this reason, it has been suggested that Lovecraft might as well be referred to as a member of a \"Smith\" circle as Smith was a member of a Lovecraft one.\nIn 1920 Smith composed a celebrated long poem in blank verse, \"The Hashish Eater, or The Apocalypse of Evil\" which was published in \"Ebony and Crystal\" (1922). This was followed by a fan letter from H. P. Lovecraft, which was the beginning of 15 years of friendship and correspondence. With studied playfulness, Smith and Lovecraft borrowed each other's coinages of place names and the names of strange gods for their stories, though so different is Smith's treatment of the Lovecraft theme that it has been dubbed the \"Clark Ashton Smythos.\"\nIn 1925 Smith published \"Sandalwood\", which was partly funded by a gift of $50 from Donald Wandrei. He wrote little fiction in this period with the exception of some imaginative vignettes or prose poems. Smith was poor for most of his life and often did hard manual jobs such as fruit picking and woodcutting to support himself and his parents. He was an able cook and made many kinds of wine. He also did well digging, typing and journalism, as well as contributing a column to \"The Auburn Journal\" and sometimes worked as its night editor.\nOne of Smith's artistic patrons and frequent correspondents was San Francisco businessman Albert M. Bender.\nProlific fiction-writing period.\nAt the beginning of the Depression in 1929, with his aged parents' health weakening, Smith resumed fiction writing and turned out more than a hundred short stories between 1929 and 1934, nearly all of which can be classed as weird horror or science fiction. Like Lovecraft, he drew upon the nightmares that had plagued him during youthful spells of sickness. Brian Stableford has written that the stories written during this brief phase of hectic productivity \"constitute one of the most remarkable oeuvres in imaginative literature\".\nHe published at his own expense a volume containing six of his best stories, \"The Double Shadow and Other Fantasies\", in an edition of 1000 copies printed by the \"Auburn Journal\". The theme of much of his work is egotism and its supernatural punishment; his weird fiction is generally macabre in subject matter, gloatingly preoccupied with images of death, decay and abnormality.\nMost of Smith's weird fiction falls into four series set variously in Hyperborea, Poseidonis, Averoigne and Zothique. Hyperborea, which is a lost continent of the Miocene period, and Poseidonis, which is a remnant of Atlantis, are much the same, with a magical culture characterized by bizarreness, cruelty, death and postmortem horrors. Averoigne is Smith's version of pre-modern France, comparable to James Branch Cabell's Poictesme. Zothique exists millions of years in the future. It is \"the last continent of earth, when the sun is dim and tarnished\". These tales have been compared to the \"Dying Earth\" sequence of Jack Vance.\nIn 1933 Smith began corresponding with Robert E. Howard, the Texan creator of Conan the Barbarian. From 1933 to 1936, Smith, Howard and Lovecraft were the leaders of the Weird Tales school of fiction and corresponded frequently, although they never met. The writer of oriental fantasies E. Hoffmann Price is the only man known to have met all three in the flesh.\nCritic Steve Behrends has suggested that the frequent theme of 'loss' in Smith's fiction (many of his characters attempt to recapture a long-vanished youth, early love, or picturesque past) may reflect Smith's own feeling that his career had suffered a \"fall from grace\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Smith's late teens and early twenties had certainly been a heady period: he'd been taken under the wing of a personal idol, the poet George Sterling, and his first book of poetry had brought him comparisons to Keats and Shelley. This notoriety must surely have raised his standing in his small hometown. And yet the depression found Smith without a job or viable occupation, unable to eke out a living as a poet, with girlfriends berating him for his lack of ambition. And while his turn to writing fiction did put bread on the table, he found it a very distasteful business at times\u2014he had once said to Sterling that writing prose was \"a hateful task, for a poet, and [one which] wouldn't be necessary in any true civilisation.\" In short, it may be that Smith experienced that variety of \"let-down\" or loss peculiar to the child prodigies.\nMid-late career: return to poetry and sculpture.\nIn September 1935, Smith's mother Fanny died. Smith spent the next two years nursing his father through his last illness. Timeus died in December 1937. Aged 44, Smith now virtually ceased writing fiction. He had been severely affected by several tragedies occurring in a short period of time: Robert E. Howard's death by suicide (1936), Lovecraft's death from cancer (1937) and the deaths of his parents, which left him exhausted. As a result, he withdrew from the scene, marking the end of \"Weird Tales\"'s Golden Age. He began sculpting and resumed the writing of poetry. However, Smith was visited by many writers at his cabin, including Fritz Leiber, Rah Hoffman, Francis T. Laney and others.\nIn 1942, three years after August Derleth founded Arkham House for the purpose of preserving the work of H.P. Lovecraft, Derleth published the first of several major collections of Smith's fiction, \"Out of Space and Time\" (1942). This was followed by \"Lost Worlds\" (1944). The books sold slowly, went out of print and became costly rarities. Derleth published five more volumes of Smith's prose and two of his verse, and at his death in 1971 had a large volume of Smith's poems in press.\nLater life, marriage and death.\nIn 1953, Smith suffered a coronary attack. Aged 61, he married Carol(yn) Jones Dorman on November 10, 1954. Dorman had much experience in Hollywood and radio public relations. After honeymooning at the Smith cabin, they moved to Pacific Grove, California, where he set up a household including her three children from a previous marriage. For several years he alternated between the house on Indian Ridge and their house in Pacific Grove. Smith having sold most of his father's tract, in 1957 the old house burned \u2013 the Smiths believed by arson, others said by accident.\nSmith now reluctantly did gardening for other residents at Pacific Grove, and grew a goatee. He spent much time shopping and walking near the seafront but despite Derleth's badgering, resisted the writing of more fiction. In 1961 he suffered a series of strokes and in August 1961 he quietly died in his sleep, aged 68. After Smith's death, Carol remarried (becoming Carolyn Wakefield) and subsequently died of cancer.\nThe poet's ashes were buried beside, or beneath, a boulder to the immediate west of where his childhood home (destroyed by fire in 1957) stood; some were also scattered in a stand of blue oaks near the boulder. There was no marker. Plaques recognizing Smith have been erected at the Auburn Placer County Library in 1985 and in Bicentennial Park in Auburn in 2003.\nBookseller Roy A. Squires was appointed Smith's \"west coast executor\", with Jack L. Chalker as his \"east coast executor\". Squires published many letterpress editions of individual Smith poems.\nSmith's literary estate is represented by his stepson, Prof William Dorman, director of CASiana Literary Enterprises. Arkham House owns the copyright to many Smith stories, though some are now in the public domain.\nFor 'posthumous collaborations' of Smith (stories completed by Lin Carter), see the entry on Lin Carter.\nArtistic periods.\nWhile Smith was always an artist who worked in several very different media, it is possible to identify three distinct periods in which one form of art had precedence over the others.\nPoetry: until 1925.\nSmith published most of his volumes of poetry in this period, including the aforementioned \"The Star-Treader and Other Poems\", as well as \"Odes and Sonnets\" (1918), \"Ebony and Crystal\" (1922) and \"Sandalwood\" (1925). His long poem \"The Hashish-Eater; Or, the Apocalypse of Evil\" was written in 1920.\nWeird fiction: 1926\u20131935.\nSmith wrote most of his weird fiction and Cthulhu Mythos stories, inspired by H. P. Lovecraft. Creatures of his invention include Aforgomon, Rlim-Shaikorth, Mordiggian, Tsathoggua, the wizard Eibon, and various others. In an homage to his friend, Lovecraft referred in \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" and \"The Battle That Ended the Century\" (written in collaboration with R. H. Barlow) to an Atlantean high-priest, \"Klarkash-Ton\".\nSmith's weird stories form several cycles, called after the lands in which they are set: Averoigne, Hyperborea, Mars, Poseidonis, Zothique. To some extent Smith was influenced in his vision of such lost worlds by the teachings of Theosophy and the writings of Helena Blavatsky. Stories set in Zothique belong to the Dying Earth subgenre. Amongst Smith's science fiction tales are stories set on Mars and the invented planet of Xiccarph.\nHis short stories originally appeared in the magazines \"Weird Tales\", \"Strange Tales\", \"Astounding Stories\", \"Stirring Science Stories\" and \"Wonder Stories\".\nClark Ashton Smith was the third member of the great triumvirate of \"Weird Tales\", with Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard.\nMany of Smith's stories were published in six hardcover volumes by August Derleth under his Arkham House imprint. For a full bibliography to 1978, see Sidney-Fryer, \"Emperor of Dreams\" (cited below). S.T. Joshi is working with other scholars to produce an updated bibliography of Smith's work.\nA selection of Smith's best-known tales includes:\nVisual art: 1935\u20131961.\nBy this time his interest in writing fiction began to lessen and he turned to creating sculptures from soft rock such as soapstone. Smith also made hundreds of fantastic paintings and drawings.\nBibliography.\nThe authoritative bibliography on Smith's work is S. T. Joshi, David E. Schultz, and Scott Conners' \"Clark Ashton Smith: A Comprehensive Bibliography.\" NY: Hippocampus Press, 2020.

{"id": "6211", "revid": "5842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6211", "title": "Context-sensitive grammar", "text": "Type of a formal grammar\nA context-sensitive grammar (CSG) is a formal grammar in which the left-hand sides and right-hand sides of any production rules may be surrounded by a context of terminal and nonterminal symbols. Context-sensitive grammars are more general than context-free grammars, in the sense that there are languages that can be described by a CSG but not by a context-free grammar. Context-sensitive grammars are less general (in the same sense) than unrestricted grammars. Thus, CSGs are positioned between context-free and unrestricted grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy.\nA formal language that can be described by a context-sensitive grammar, or, equivalently, by a noncontracting grammar or a linear bounded automaton, is called a context-sensitive language. Some textbooks actually define CSGs as non-contracting, although this is not how Noam Chomsky defined them in 1959. This choice of definition makes no difference in terms of the languages generated (i.e. the two definitions are weakly equivalent), but it does make a difference in terms of what grammars are structurally considered context-sensitive; the latter issue was analyzed by Chomsky in 1963.\nChomsky introduced context-sensitive grammars as a way to describe the syntax of natural language where it is often the case that a word may or may not be appropriate in a certain place depending on the context. Walter Savitch has criticized the terminology \"context-sensitive\" as misleading and proposed \"non-erasing\" as better explaining the distinction between a CSG and an unrestricted grammar.\nAlthough it is well known that certain features of languages (e.g. cross-serial dependency) are not context-free, it is an open question how much of CSGs' expressive power is needed to capture the context sensitivity found in natural languages. Subsequent research in this area has focused on the more computationally tractable mildly context-sensitive languages. The syntaxes of some visual programming languages can be described by context-sensitive graph grammars.\nFormal definition.\nFormal grammar.\nLet us notate a formal grammar as formula_1, with formula_2 a set of nonterminal symbols, formula_3 a set of terminal symbols, formula_4 a set of production rules, and formula_5 the start symbol.\nA string formula_6 \"directly yields\", or \"directly derives to\", a string formula_7, denoted as formula_8, if \"v\" can be obtained from \"u\" by an application of some production rule in \"P\", that is, if formula_9 and formula_10, where formula_11 is a production rule, and formula_12 is the unaffected left and right part of the string, respectively.\nMore generally, \"u\" is said to \"yield\", or \"derive to\", \"v\", denoted as formula_13, if \"v\" can be obtained from \"u\" by repeated application of production rules, that is, if formula_14 for some \"n\" \u2265 0 and some strings formula_15. In other words, the relation formula_16 is the reflexive transitive closure of the relation formula_17.\nThe language of the grammar \"G\" is the set of all terminal-symbol strings derivable from its start symbol, formally: formula_18.\nDerivations that do not end in a string composed of terminal symbols only are possible, but do not contribute to \"L\"(\"G\").\nContext-sensitive grammar.\nA formal grammar is context-sensitive if each rule in \"P\" is either of the form formula_19 where formula_20 is the empty string, or of the form\n \u03b1\"A\"\u03b2 \u2192 \u03b1\u03b3\u03b2\nwith \"A\" \u2208 \"N\", formula_21, and formula_22.\nThe name \"context-sensitive\" is explained by the \u03b1 and \u03b2 that form the context of \"A\" and determine whether \"A\" can be replaced with \u03b3 or not.\nBy contrast, in a context-free grammar, no context is present: the left hand side of every production rule is just a nonterminal.\nThe string \u03b3 is not allowed to be empty. Without this restriction, the resulting grammars become equal in power to unrestricted grammars.\n(Weakly) equivalent definitions.\nA noncontracting grammar is a grammar in which for any production rule, of the form \"u\" \u2192 \"v\", the length of \"u\" is less than or equal to the length of \"v\".\nEvery context-sensitive grammar is noncontracting, while every noncontracting grammar can be converted into an equivalent context-sensitive grammar; the two classes are weakly equivalent.\nSome authors use the term \"context-sensitive grammar\" to refer to noncontracting grammars in general.\nThe left-context- and right-context-sensitive grammars are defined by restricting the rules to just the form \u03b1\"A\" \u2192 \u03b1\u03b3 and to just \"A\"\u03b2 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b2, respectively. The languages generated by these grammars are also the full class of context-sensitive languages. The equivalence was established by Penttonen normal form.\nExamples.\n\"anbncn\".\nThe following context-sensitive grammar, with start symbol \"S\", generates the canonical non-context-free language { \"anbncn\" | \"n\" \u2265 1 } :\nRules 1 and 2 allow for blowing-up \"S\" to \"a\"\"n\"\"BC\"(\"BC\")\"n\"\u22121; rules 3 to 6 allow for successively exchanging each \"CB\" to \"BC\" (four rules are needed for that since a rule \"CB\" \u2192 \"BC\" wouldn't fit into the scheme \u03b1\"A\"\u03b2 \u2192 \u03b1\u03b3\u03b2); rules 7\u201310 allow replacing a non-terminals \"B\" and \"C\" with its corresponding terminals \"b\" and \"c\" respectively, provided it is in the right place.\nA generation chain for \"aaabbbccc\" is:\n \"S\"\n \u21922 aSBC\n \u21922 \"aaSBCBC\"\n \u21921 \"aaaBCBCBC\"\n \u21923 \"aaaBCZCBC\"\n \u21924 \"aaaBWZCBC\"\n \u21925 \"aaaBWCCBC\"\n \u21926 \"aaaBBCCBC\"\n \u21923 \"aaaBBCCZC\"\n \u21924 \"aaaBBCWZC\"\n \u21925 \"aaaBBCWCC\"\n \u21926 \"aaaBBCBCC\"\n \u21923 \"aaaBBCZCC\"\n \u21924 \"aaaBBWZCC\"\n \u21925 \"aaaBBWCCC\"\n \u21926 \"aaaBBBCCC\"\n \u21927 \"aaabBBCCC\"\n \u21928 \"aaabbBCCC\"\n \u21928 \"aaabbbCCC\"\n \u21929 \"aaabbbcCC\"\n \u219210 \"aaabbbccC\"\n \u219210 \"aaabbbccc\"\n\"anbncndn\", etc..\nMore complicated grammars can be used to parse { \"anbncndn\" | \"n\" \u2265 1 }, and other languages with even more letters. Here we show a simpler approach using non-contracting grammars:\nStart with a kernel of regular productions generating the sentential forms\nformula_23 and then include the non contracting productions\nformula_24,\nformula_25,\nformula_26,\nformula_27,\nformula_28,\nformula_29,\nformula_30,\nformula_31,\nformula_32,\nformula_33.\n\"ambncmdn\".\nA non contracting grammar (for which there is an equivalent CSG) for the language formula_34 is defined by\nformula_35,\nformula_36,\nformula_37,\nformula_38,\nformula_39, \nformula_40, \nformula_41, and\nformula_42.\nWith these definitions, a derivation for formula_43 is:\nformula_44.\n\"a\"2\"i\".\nA noncontracting grammar for the language { \"a\"2\"i\" | \"i\" \u2265 1 } is constructed in Example 9.5 (p.\u00a0224) of (Hopcroft, Ullman, 1979):\nKuroda normal form.\nEvery context-sensitive grammar which does not generate the empty string can be transformed into a weakly equivalent one in Kuroda normal form. \"Weakly equivalent\" here means that the two grammars generate the same language. The normal form will not in general be context-sensitive, but will be a noncontracting grammar.\nThe Kuroda normal form is an actual normal form for non-contracting grammars.\nProperties and uses.\nEquivalence to linear bounded automaton.\nA formal language can be described by a context-sensitive grammar if and only if it is accepted by some linear bounded automaton (LBA). In some textbooks this result is attributed solely to Landweber and Kuroda. Others call it the Myhill\u2013Landweber\u2013Kuroda theorem. (Myhill introduced the concept of deterministic LBA in 1960. Peter S. Landweber published in 1963 that the language accepted by a deterministic LBA is context sensitive. Kuroda introduced the notion of non-deterministic LBA and the equivalence between LBA and CSGs in 1964.)\nAs of 2010[ [update]] it is still an open question whether every context-sensitive language can be accepted by a \"deterministic\" LBA.\nClosure properties.\nContext-sensitive languages are closed under complement. This 1988 result is known as the Immerman\u2013Szelepcs\u00e9nyi theorem.\nMoreover, they are closed under union, intersection, concatenation, substitution, inverse homomorphism, and Kleene plus.\nEvery recursively enumerable language \"L\" can be written as \"h\"(\"L\") for some context-sensitive language \"L\" and some string homomorphism \"h\".\nComputational problems.\nThe decision problem that asks whether a certain string \"s\" belongs to the language of a given context-sensitive grammar \"G\", is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, there are context-sensitive grammars whose languages are PSPACE-complete. In other words, there is a context-sensitive grammar \"G\" such that deciding whether a certain string \"s\" belongs to the language of \"G\" is PSPACE-complete (so \"G\" is fixed and only \"s\" is part of the input of the problem).\nThe emptiness problem for context-sensitive grammars (given a context-sensitive grammar \"G\", is \"L\"(\"G\")=\u2205 ?) is undecidable.\nAs model of natural languages.\nSavitch has proven the following theoretical result, on which he bases his criticism of CSGs as basis for natural language: for any recursively enumerable set \"R\", there exists a context-sensitive language/grammar \"G\" which can be used as a sort of proxy to test membership in \"R\" in the following way: given a string \"s\", \"s\" is in \"R\" if and only if there exists a positive integer \"n\" for which \"scn\" is in G, where \"c\" is an arbitrary symbol not part of \"R\".\nIt has been shown that nearly all natural languages may in general be characterized by context-sensitive grammars, but the whole class of CSGs seems to be much bigger than natural languages. Worse yet, since the aforementioned decision problem for CSGs is PSPACE-complete, that makes them totally unworkable for practical use, as a polynomial-time algorithm for a PSPACE-complete problem would imply P=NP.\nIt was proven that some natural languages are not context-free, based on identifying so-called cross-serial dependencies and unbounded scrambling phenomena. However this does not necessarily imply that the class of CSGs is necessary to capture \"context sensitivity\" in the colloquial sense of these terms in natural languages. For example, linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRSs) are strictly weaker than CSGs but can account for the phenomenon of cross-serial dependencies; one can write a LCFRS grammar for {\"anbncndn\" | \"n\" \u2265 1} for example.\nOngoing research on computational linguistics has focused on formulating other classes of languages that are \"mildly context-sensitive\" whose decision problems are feasible, such as tree-adjoining grammars, combinatory categorial grammars, coupled context-free languages, and linear context-free rewriting systems. The languages generated by these formalisms properly lie between the context-free and context-sensitive languages.\nMore recently, the class PTIME has been identified with range concatenation grammars, which are now considered to be the most expressive of the mild-context sensitive language classes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Context-sensitive is one of the four types of grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy.\nComputational properties.\nComputationally, a context-sensitive language is equivalent to a linear bounded nondeterministic Turing machine, also called a linear bounded automaton. That is a non-deterministic Turing machine with a tape of only formula_1 cells, where formula_2 is the size of the input and formula_3 is a constant associated with the machine. This means that every formal language that can be decided by such a machine is a context-sensitive language, and every context-sensitive language can be decided by such a machine.\nThis set of languages is also known as NLINSPACE or NSPACE(\"O\"(\"n\")), because they can be accepted using linear space on a non-deterministic Turing machine. The class LINSPACE (or DSPACE(\"O\"(\"n\"))) is defined the same, except using a deterministic Turing machine. Clearly LINSPACE is a subset of NLINSPACE, but it is not known whether LINSPACE\u2009=\u2009NLINSPACE.\nExamples.\nOne of the simplest context-sensitive but not context-free languages is formula_4: the language of all strings consisting of n occurrences of the symbol \"a\", then n \"b\"s, then n \"c\"s (abc, aabbcc, aaabbbccc, etc.). A superset of this language, called the Bach language, is defined as the set of all strings where \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\" (or any other set of three symbols) occurs equally often (aabccb, baabcaccb, etc.) and is also context-sensitive.\nL can be shown to be a context-sensitive language by constructing a linear bounded automaton which accepts L. The language can easily be shown to be neither regular nor context-free by applying the respective pumping lemmas for each of the language classes to L.\nSimilarly:\nformula_5 is another context-sensitive language; the corresponding context-sensitive grammar can be easily projected starting with two context-free grammars generating sentential forms in the formats\nformula_6\nand\nformula_7\nand then supplementing them with a permutation production like \nformula_8, a new starting symbol and standard syntactic sugar.\nformula_9 is another context-sensitive language (the \"3\" in the name of this language is intended to mean a ternary alphabet); that is, the \"product\" operation defines a context-sensitive language (but the \"sum\" defines only a context-free language as the grammar formula_10 and formula_11 shows). Because of the commutative property of the product, the most intuitive grammar for formula_12 is ambiguous. This problem can be avoided considering a somehow more restrictive definition of the language, e.g. formula_13. This can be specialized to \nformula_14 and, from this, to formula_15, formula_16, etc.\nformula_17 is a context-sensitive language. The corresponding context-sensitive grammar can be obtained as a generalization of the context-sensitive grammars for formula_18, formula_19, etc.\nformula_20 is a context-sensitive language.\nformula_21 is a context-sensitive language (the \"2\" in the name of this language is intended to mean a binary alphabet). This was proved by Hartmanis using pumping lemmas for regular and context-free languages over a binary alphabet and, after that, sketching a linear bounded multitape automaton accepting formula_22.\nformula_23 is a context-sensitive language (the \"1\" in the name of this language is intended to mean an unary alphabet). This was credited by A. Salomaa to Matti Soittola by means of a linear bounded automaton over an unary alphabet (pages 213-214, exercise 6.8) and also to Marti Penttonen by means of a context-sensitive grammar also over an unary alphabet (See: Formal Languages by A. Salomaa, page 14, Example 2.5).\nAn example of recursive language that is not context-sensitive is any recursive language whose decision is an EXPSPACE-hard problem, say, the set of pairs of equivalent regular expressions with exponentiation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6216", "revid": "9813438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6216", "title": "Chinese room", "text": "Thought experiment on artificial intelligence by John Searle\nThe Chinese room argument holds that a digital computer executing a program cannot have a \"mind\", \"understanding\", or \"consciousness\", regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave. The argument was presented by philosopher John Searle in his paper \"Minds, Brains, and Programs\", published in \"Behavioral and Brain Sciences\" in 1980. Similar arguments were presented by Gottfried Leibniz (1714), Anatoly Dneprov (1961), Lawrence Davis (1974) and Ned Block (1978). Searle's version has been widely discussed in the years since. The centerpiece of Searle's argument is a thought experiment known as the Chinese room.\nThe argument is directed against the philosophical positions of functionalism and computationalism which hold that the mind may be viewed as an information-processing system operating on formal symbols, and that simulation of a given mental state is sufficient for its presence. Specifically, the argument is intended to refute a position Searle calls strong AI: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"\nAlthough it was originally presented in reaction to the statements of artificial intelligence (AI) researchers, it is not an argument against the goals of mainstream AI research because it does not show a limit in the amount of \"intelligent\" behavior a machine can display. The argument applies only to digital computers running programs and does not apply to machines in general.\nChinese room thought experiment.\nSearle's thought experiment begins with this hypothetical premise: suppose that artificial intelligence research has succeeded in constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands Chinese. It takes Chinese characters as input and, by following the instructions of a computer program, produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the Turing test: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all of the questions that the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.\nThe question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine \"literally\" \"understand\" Chinese? Or is it merely \"simulating\" the ability to understand Chinese? Searle calls the first position \"strong AI\" and the latter \"weak AI\".\nSearle then supposes that he is in a closed room and has a book with an English version of the computer program, along with sufficient papers, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output, without understanding any of the content of the Chinese writing. If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle, that he would do so as well, simply by running the program manually.\nSearle asserts that there is no essential difference between the roles of the computer and himself in the experiment. Each simply follows a program, step-by-step, producing behavior that is then interpreted by the user as demonstrating intelligent conversation. However, Searle himself would not be able to understand the conversation. (\"I don't speak a word of Chinese\", he points out.) Therefore, he argues, it follows that the computer would not be able to understand the conversation either.\nSearle argues that, without \"understanding\" (or \"intentionality\"), we cannot describe what the machine is doing as \"thinking\" and, since it does not think, it does not have a \"mind\" in anything like the normal sense of the word. Therefore, he concludes that the \"strong AI\" hypothesis is false.\nHistory.\nGottfried Leibniz made a similar argument in 1714 against mechanism (the idea that everything that makes up a human being could, in principle, be explained in mechanical terms. In other words that a person, including their mind, is merely a very complex machine). Leibniz used the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a mill. Leibniz found it difficult to imagine that a \"mind\" capable of \"perception\" could be constructed using only mechanical processes. \nSoviet cyberneticist Anatoly Dneprov made an essentially identical argument in 1961, in the form of the short story \"The Game\". In it, a stadium of people act as switches and memory cells implementing a program to translate a sentence of Portuguese, a language that none of them knows. The game was organized by a \"Professor Zarubin\" to answer the question \"Can mathematical machines think?\" Speaking through Zarubin, Dneprov writes \"the only way to prove that machines can think is to turn yourself into a machine and examine your thinking process\" and he concludes, as Searle does, \"We've proven that even the most perfect simulation of machine thinking is not the thinking process itself.\" \nIn 1974, Lawrence Davis imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people, and in 1978 Ned Block envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation. This thought experiment is called the China brain, also the \"Chinese Nation\" or the \"Chinese Gym\". \nSearle's version appeared in his 1980 paper \"Minds, Brains, and Programs\", published in \"Behavioral and Brain Sciences\". It eventually became the journal's \"most influential target article\", generating an enormous number of commentaries and responses in the ensuing decades, and Searle has continued to defend and refine the argument in many papers, popular articles and books. David Cole writes that \"the Chinese Room argument has probably been the most widely discussed philosophical argument in cognitive science to appear in the past 25 years\".\nMost of the discussion consists of attempts to refute it. \"The overwhelming majority\", notes \"BBS\" editor Stevan Harnad, \"still think that the Chinese Room Argument is dead wrong\". The sheer volume of the literature that has grown up around it inspired Pat Hayes to comment that the field of cognitive science ought to be redefined as \"the ongoing research program of showing Searle's Chinese Room Argument to be false\".\nSearle's argument has become \"something of a classic in cognitive science\", according to Harnad. Varol Akman agrees, and has described the original paper as \"an exemplar of philosophical clarity and purity\".\nPhilosophy.\nAlthough the Chinese Room argument was originally presented in reaction to the statements of artificial intelligence researchers, philosophers have come to consider it as an important part of the philosophy of mind. It is a challenge to functionalism and the computational theory of mind, and is related to such questions as the mind\u2013body problem, the problem of other minds, the symbol-grounding problem, and the hard problem of consciousness.\nStrong AI.\nSearle identified a philosophical position he calls \"strong AI\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\nThe definition depends on the distinction between \"simulating\" a mind and \"actually having\" a mind. Searle writes that \"according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind.\"\nThe claim is implicit in some of the statements of early AI researchers and analysts. For example, in 1955, AI founder Herbert A. Simon declared that \"there are now in the world machines that think, that learn and create\". Simon, together with Allen Newell and Cliff Shaw, after having completed the first \"AI\" program, the Logic Theorist, claimed that they had \"solved the venerable mind\u2013body problem, explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind.\" John Haugeland wrote that \"AI wants only the genuine article: \"machines with minds\", in the full and literal sense. This is not science fiction, but real science, based on a theoretical conception as deep as it is daring: namely, we are, at root, \"computers ourselves\".\"\nSearle also ascribes the following claims to advocates of strong AI:\nStrong AI as computationalism or functionalism.\nIn more recent presentations of the Chinese room argument, Searle has identified \"strong AI\" as \"computer functionalism\" (a term he attributes to Daniel Dennett). Functionalism is a position in modern philosophy of mind that holds that we can define mental phenomena (such as beliefs, desires, and perceptions) by describing their functions in relation to each other and to the outside world. Because a computer program can accurately represent functional relationships as relationships between symbols, a computer can have mental phenomena if it runs the right program, according to functionalism.\nStevan Harnad argues that Searle's depictions of strong AI can be reformulated as \"recognizable tenets of \"computationalism\", a position (unlike \"strong AI\") that is actually held by many thinkers, and hence one worth refuting.\" Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind which argues that the mind can be accurately described as an information-processing system.\nEach of the following, according to Harnad, is a \"tenet\" of computationalism:\nStrong AI vs. biological naturalism.\nSearle holds a philosophical position he calls \"biological naturalism\": that consciousness and understanding require specific biological machinery that are found in brains. He writes \"brains cause minds\" and that \"actual human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical\u2013chemical properties of actual human brains\". Searle argues that this machinery (known to neuroscience as the \"neural correlates of consciousness\") must have some causal powers that permit the human experience of consciousness. Searle's belief in the existence of these powers has been criticized.\nSearle does not disagree with the notion that machines can have consciousness and understanding, because, as he writes, \"we are precisely such machines\". Searle holds that the brain is, in fact, a machine, but that the brain gives rise to consciousness and understanding using machinery that is non-computational. If neuroscience is able to isolate the mechanical process that gives rise to consciousness, then Searle grants that it may be possible to create machines that have consciousness and understanding. However, without the specific machinery required, Searle does not believe that consciousness can occur.\nBiological naturalism implies that one cannot determine if the experience of consciousness is occurring merely by examining how a system functions, because the specific machinery of the brain is essential. Thus, biological naturalism is directly opposed to both behaviorism and functionalism (including \"computer functionalism\" or \"strong AI\"). Biological naturalism is similar to identity theory (the position that mental states are \"identical to\" or \"composed of\" neurological events); however, Searle has specific technical objections to identity theory. Searle's biological naturalism and strong AI are both opposed to Cartesian dualism, the classical idea that the brain and mind are made of different \"substances\". Indeed, Searle accuses strong AI of dualism, writing that \"strong AI only makes sense given the dualistic assumption that, where the mind is concerned, the brain doesn't matter.\"\nConsciousness.\nSearle's original presentation emphasized \"understanding\"\u2014that is, mental states with what philosophers call \"intentionality\"\u2014and did not directly address other closely related ideas such as \"consciousness\". However, in more recent presentations, Searle has included consciousness as the real target of the argument.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Computational models of consciousness are not sufficient by themselves for consciousness. The computational model for consciousness stands to consciousness in the same way the computational model of anything stands to the domain being modelled. Nobody supposes that the computational model of rainstorms in London will leave us all wet. But they make the mistake of supposing that the computational model of consciousness is somehow conscious. It is the same mistake in both cases.\nDavid Chalmers writes, \"it is fairly clear that consciousness is at the root of the matter\" of the Chinese room.\nColin McGinn argues that the Chinese room provides strong evidence that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be clear, is not about whether a machine can be conscious, but about whether it (or anything else for that matter) can be shown to be conscious. It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.\nSearle argues that this is only true for an observer \"outside\" of the room. The whole point of the thought experiment is to put someone \"inside\" the room, where they can directly observe the operations of consciousness. Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is nothing he can see that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and clearly he does not have a mind that can speak Chinese.\nApplied ethics.\nPatrick Hew used the Chinese Room argument to deduce requirements from military command and control systems if they are to preserve a commander's moral agency. He drew an analogy between a commander in their command center and the person in the Chinese Room, and analyzed it under a reading of Aristotle\u2019s notions of \"compulsory\" and \"ignorance\". Information could be \"down converted\" from meaning to symbols, and manipulated symbolically, but moral agency could be undermined if there was inadequate 'up conversion' into meaning. Hew cited examples from the USS \"Vincennes\" incident.\nComputer science.\nThe Chinese room argument is primarily an argument in the philosophy of mind, and both major computer scientists and artificial intelligence researchers consider it irrelevant to their fields. However, several concepts developed by computer scientists are essential to understanding the argument, including symbol processing, Turing machines, Turing completeness, and the Turing test.\nStrong AI vs. AI research.\nSearle's arguments are not usually considered an issue for AI research. Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig observe that most AI researchers \"don't care about the strong AI hypothesis\u2014as long as the program works, they don't care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence.\" The primary mission of artificial intelligence research is only to create useful systems that \"act\" intelligently, and it does not matter if the intelligence is \"merely\" a simulation.\nSearle does not disagree that AI research can create machines that are capable of highly intelligent behavior. The Chinese room argument leaves open the possibility that a digital machine could be built that \"acts\" more intelligently than a person, but does not have a mind or intentionality in the same way that brains do.\nSearle's \"strong AI\" should not be confused with \"strong AI\" as defined by Ray Kurzweil and other futurists, who use the term to describe machine intelligence that rivals or exceeds human intelligence. Kurzweil is concerned primarily with the \"amount\" of intelligence displayed by the machine, whereas Searle's argument sets no limit on this. Searle argues that even a superintelligent machine would not necessarily have a mind and consciousness.\nTuring test.\nThe Chinese room implements a version of the Turing test. Alan Turing introduced the test in 1950 to help answer the question \"can machines think?\" In the standard version, a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with a human and a machine designed to generate performance indistinguishable from that of a human being. All participants are separated from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.\nTuring then considered each possible objection to the proposal \"machines can think\", and found that there are simple, obvious answers if the question is de-mystified in this way. He did not, however, intend for the test to measure for the presence of \"consciousness\" or \"understanding\". He did not believe this was relevant to the issues that he was addressing. He wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness. There is, for instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it. But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper.\nTo Searle, as a philosopher investigating in the nature of mind and consciousness, these are the relevant mysteries. The Chinese room is designed to show that the Turing test is insufficient to detect the presence of consciousness, even if the room can behave or function as a conscious mind would.\nSymbol processing.\nThe Chinese room (and all modern computers) manipulate physical objects in order to carry out calculations and do simulations. AI researchers Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon called this kind of machine a physical symbol system. It is also equivalent to the formal systems used in the field of mathematical logic.\nSearle emphasizes the fact that this kind of symbol manipulation is syntactic (borrowing a term from the study of grammar). The computer manipulates the symbols using a form of syntax rules, without any knowledge of the symbol's semantics (that is, their meaning).\nNewell and Simon had conjectured that a physical symbol system (such as a digital computer) had all the necessary machinery for \"general intelligent action\", or, as it is known today, artificial general intelligence. They framed this as a philosophical position, the physical symbol system hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action.\" The Chinese room argument does not refute this, because it is framed in terms of \"intelligent action\", i.e. the external behavior of the machine, rather than the presence or absence of understanding, consciousness and mind.\nChinese room and Turing completeness.\nThe Chinese room has a design analogous to that of a modern computer. It has a Von Neumann architecture, which consists of a program (the book of instructions), some memory (the papers and file cabinets), a CPU that follows the instructions (the man), and a means to write symbols in memory (the pencil and eraser). A machine with this design is known in theoretical computer science as \"Turing complete\", because it has the necessary machinery to carry out any computation that a Turing machine can do, and therefore it is capable of doing a step-by-step simulation of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. Alan Turing writes, \"all digital computers are in a sense equivalent.\" The widely accepted Church\u2013Turing thesis holds that any function computable by an effective procedure is computable by a Turing machine.\nThe Turing completeness of the Chinese room implies that it can do whatever any other digital computer can do (albeit much, much more slowly). Thus, if the Chinese room does not or can not contain a Chinese-speaking mind, then no other digital computer can contain a mind. Some replies to Searle begin by arguing that the room, as described, cannot have a Chinese-speaking mind. Arguments of this form, according to Stevan Harnad, are \"no refutation (but rather an affirmation)\" of the Chinese room argument, because these arguments actually imply that \"no\" digital computers can have a mind.\nThere are some critics, such as Hanoch Ben-Yami, who argue that the Chinese room cannot simulate all the abilities of a digital computer, such as being able to determine the current time.\nComplete argument.\nSearle has produced a more formal version of the argument of which the Chinese Room forms a part. He presented the first version in 1984. The version given below is from 1990. The Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove point A3.\nHe begins with three axioms:\n(A1) \"Programs are formal (syntactic).\"\nA program uses syntax to manipulate symbols and pays no attention to the semantics of the symbols. It knows where to put the symbols and how to move them around, but it does not know what they stand for or what they mean. For the program, the symbols are just physical objects like any others.\n(A2) \"Minds have mental contents (semantics).\"\nUnlike the symbols used by a program, our thoughts have meaning: they represent things and we know what it is they represent.\n(A3) \"Syntax by itself is neither constitutive of nor sufficient for semantics.\"\nThis is what the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove: the Chinese room has syntax (because there is a man in there moving symbols around). The Chinese room has no semantics (because, according to Searle, there is no one or nothing in the room that understands what the symbols mean). Therefore, having syntax is not enough to generate semantics.\nSearle posits that these lead directly to this conclusion:\n(C1) Programs are neither constitutive of nor sufficient for minds.\nThis should follow without controversy from the first three: Programs don't have semantics. Programs have only syntax, and syntax is insufficient for semantics. Every mind has semantics. Therefore no programs are minds.\nThis much of the argument is intended to show that artificial intelligence can never produce a machine with a mind by writing programs that manipulate symbols. The remainder of the argument addresses a different issue. Is the human brain running a program? In other words, is the computational theory of mind correct? He begins with an axiom that is intended to express the basic modern scientific consensus about brains and minds:\n(A4) Brains cause minds.\nSearle claims that we can derive \"immediately\" and \"trivially\" that:\n(C2) Any other system capable of causing minds would have to have causal powers (at least) equivalent to those of brains.\nBrains must have something that causes a mind to exist. Science has yet to determine exactly what it is, but it must exist, because minds exist. Searle calls it \"causal powers\". \"Causal powers\" is whatever the brain uses to create a mind. If anything else can cause a mind to exist, it must have \"equivalent causal powers\". \"Equivalent causal powers\" is whatever \"else\" that could be used to make a mind.\nAnd from this he derives the further conclusions:\n(C3) Any artifact that produced mental phenomena, any artificial brain, would have to be able to duplicate the specific causal powers of brains, and it could not do that just by running a formal program.\nThis follows from C1 and C2: Since no program can produce a mind, and \"equivalent causal powers\" produce minds, it follows that programs do not have \"equivalent causal powers.\"\n(C4) The way that human brains actually produce mental phenomena cannot be solely by virtue of running a computer program.\nSince programs do not have \"equivalent causal powers\", \"equivalent causal powers\" produce minds, and brains produce minds, it follows that brains do not use programs to produce minds.\nRefutations of Searle's argument take many different forms (see below). Computationalists and functionalists reject A3, arguing that \"syntax\" (as Searle describes it) \"can\" have \"semantics\" if the syntax has the right functional structure. Eliminative materialists reject A2, arguing that minds don't actually have \"semantics\" -- that thoughts and other mental phenomena are inherently meaningless but nevertheless function as if they had meaning.\nReplies.\nReplies to Searle's argument may be classified according to what they claim to show:\nSome of the arguments (robot and brain simulation, for example) fall into multiple categories.\nSystems and virtual mind replies: finding the mind.\nThese replies attempt to answer the question: since the man in the room does not speak Chinese, \"where\" is the \"mind\" that does? These replies address the key ontological issues of mind vs. body and simulation vs. reality. All of the replies that identify the mind in the room are versions of \"the system reply\".\nThe basic version of the system reply argues that it is the \"whole system\" that understands Chinese. While the man understands only English, when he is combined with the program, scratch paper, pencils and file cabinets, they form a system that can understand Chinese. \"Here, understanding is not being ascribed to the mere individual; rather it is being ascribed to this whole system of which he is a part\" Searle explains. The fact that a certain man does not understand Chinese is irrelevant, because it is only the system as a whole that matters.\nSearle notes that (in this simple version of the reply) the \"system\" is nothing more than a collection of ordinary physical objects; it grants the power of understanding and consciousness to \"the conjunction of that person and bits of paper\" without making any effort to explain how this pile of objects has become a conscious, thinking being. Searle argues that no reasonable person should be satisfied with the reply, unless they are \"under the grip of an ideology;\" In order for this reply to be remotely plausible, one must take it for granted that consciousness can be the product of an information processing \"system\", and does not require anything resembling the actual biology of the brain.\nSearle then responds by simplifying this list of physical objects: he asks what happens if the man memorizes the rules and keeps track of everything in his head? Then the whole system consists of just one object: the man himself. Searle argues that if the man does not understand Chinese then the system does not understand Chinese either because now \"the system\" and \"the man\" both describe exactly the same object.\nCritics of Searle's response argue that the program has allowed the man to have two minds in one head. If we assume a \"mind\" is a form of information processing, then the theory of computation can account for two computations occurring at once, namely (1) the computation for universal programmability (which is the function instantiated by the person and note-taking materials \"independently\" from any particular program contents) and (2) the computation of the Turing machine that is described by the program (which is instantiated by everything \"including\" the specific program). The theory of computation thus formally explains the open possibility that the second computation in the Chinese Room could entail a human-equivalent semantic understanding of the Chinese inputs. The focus belongs on the program's Turing machine rather than on the person's. However, from Searle's perspective, this argument is circular. The question at issue is whether consciousness is a form of information processing, and this reply requires that we make that assumption.\nMore sophisticated versions of the systems reply try to identify more precisely what \"the system\" is and they differ in exactly how they describe it. According to these replies, the \"mind that speaks Chinese\" could be such things as: the \"software\", a \"program\", a \"running program\", a simulation of the \"neural correlates of consciousness\", the \"functional system\", a \"simulated mind\", an \"emergent property\", or \"a virtual mind\" (described below).\nMarvin Minsky suggested a version of the system reply known as the \"virtual mind reply\". The term \"virtual\" is used in computer science to describe an object that appears to exist \"in\" a computer (or computer network) only because software makes it appear to exist. The objects \"inside\" computers (including files, folders, and so on) are all \"virtual\", except for the computer's electronic components. Similarly, Minsky argues, a computer may contain a \"mind\" that is virtual in the same sense as virtual machines, virtual communities and virtual reality.\nTo clarify the distinction between the simple systems reply given above and virtual mind reply, David Cole notes that two simulations could be running on one system at the same time: one speaking Chinese and one speaking Korean. While there is only one system, there can be multiple \"virtual minds,\" thus the \"system\" cannot be the \"mind\".\nSearle responds that such a mind is, at best, a simulation, and writes: \"No one supposes that computer simulations of a five-alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched.\" Nicholas Fearn responds that, for some things, simulation is as good as the real thing. \"When we call up the pocket calculator function on a desktop computer, the image of a pocket calculator appears on the screen. We don't complain that 'it isn't \"really\" a calculator', because the physical attributes of the device do not matter.\" The question is, is the human mind like the pocket calculator, essentially composed of information? Or is the mind like the rainstorm, something other than a computer, and not realizable in full by a computer simulation? For decades, this question of simulation has led AI researchers and philosophers to consider whether the term \"synthetic intelligence\" is more appropriate than the common description of such intelligences as \"artificial.\"\nThese replies provide an explanation of exactly who it is that understands Chinese. If there is something \"besides\" the man in the room that can understand Chinese, Searle cannot argue that (1) the man does not understand Chinese, therefore (2) nothing in the room understands Chinese. This, according to those who make this reply, shows that Searle's argument fails to prove that \"strong AI\" is false.\nThese replies, by themselves, do not provide any evidence that strong AI is \"true\", however. They do not show that the system (or the virtual mind) understands Chinese, other than the hypothetical premise that it passes the Turing Test. Searle argues that, if we are to consider Strong AI remotely plausible, the Chinese Room is an example that requires explanation, and it is difficult or impossible to explain how consciousness might \"emerge\" from the room or how the system would have consciousness. As Searle writes \"the systems reply simply begs the question by insisting that the system must understand Chinese\" and thus is dodging the question or hopelessly circular.\nRobot and semantics replies: finding the meaning.\nAs far as the person in the room is concerned, the symbols are just meaningless \"squiggles.\" But if the Chinese room really \"understands\" what it is saying, then the symbols must get their meaning from somewhere. These arguments attempt to connect the symbols to the things they symbolize. These replies address Searle's concerns about intentionality, symbol grounding and syntax vs. semantics.\nSuppose that instead of a room, the program was placed into a robot that could wander around and interact with its environment. This would allow a \"causal connection\" between the symbols and things they represent. Hans Moravec comments: \"If we could graft a robot to a reasoning program, we wouldn't need a person to provide the meaning anymore: it would come from the physical world.\"\nSearle's reply is to suppose that, unbeknownst to the individual in the Chinese room, some of the inputs came directly from a camera mounted on a robot, and some of the outputs were used to manipulate the arms and legs of the robot. Nevertheless, the person in the room is still just following the rules, and \"does not know what the symbols mean.\" Searle writes \"he doesn't \"see\" what comes into the robot's eyes.\" (See Mary's room for a similar thought experiment.)\n Some respond that the room, as Searle describes it, \"is\" connected to the world: through the Chinese speakers that it is \"talking\" to and through the programmers who designed the knowledge base in his file cabinet. The symbols Searle manipulates \"are already meaningful\", they're just not meaningful to \"him\".\nSearle says that the symbols only have a \"derived\" meaning, like the meaning of words in books. The meaning of the symbols depends on the conscious understanding of the Chinese speakers and the programmers outside the room. The room, like a book, has no understanding of its own.\nSome have argued that the meanings of the symbols would come from a vast \"background\" of commonsense knowledge encoded in the program and the filing cabinets. This would provide a \"context\" that would give the symbols their meaning.\nSearle agrees that this background exists, but he does not agree that it can be built into programs. Hubert Dreyfus has also criticized the idea that the \"background\" can be represented symbolically.\nCommonsense knowledge / contextualist reply.\nTo each of these suggestions, Searle's response is the same: no matter how much knowledge is written into the program and no matter how the program is connected to the world, he is still in the room manipulating symbols according to rules. His actions are syntactic and this can never explain to him what the symbols stand for. Searle writes \"syntax is insufficient for semantics.\"\nHowever, for those who accept that Searle's actions simulate a mind, separate from his own, the important question is not what the symbols mean \"to Searle\", what is important is what they mean \"to the virtual mind.\" While Searle is trapped in the room, the virtual mind is not: it is connected to the outside world through the Chinese speakers it speaks to, through the programmers who gave it world knowledge, and through the cameras and other sensors that roboticists can supply.\nBrain simulation and connectionist replies: redesigning the room.\nThese arguments are all versions of the systems reply that identify a particular \"kind\" of system as being important; they identify some special technology that would create conscious understanding in a machine. (The \"robot\" and \"commonsense knowledge\" replies above also specify a certain kind of system as being important.)\nSuppose that the program simulated in fine detail the action of every neuron in the brain of a Chinese speaker. This strengthens the intuition that there would be no significant difference between the operation of the program and the operation of a live human brain.\nSearle replies that such a simulation does not reproduce the important features of the brain\u2014its causal and intentional states. Searle is adamant that \"human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical\u2013chemical properties of actual human brains.\" Moreover, he argues:\nBrain simulator reply.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[I]magine that instead of a monolingual man in a room shuffling symbols we have the man operate an elaborate set of water pipes with valves connecting them. When the man receives the Chinese symbols, he looks up in the program, written in English, which valves he has to turn on and off. Each water connection corresponds to a synapse in the Chinese brain, and the whole system is rigged up so that after doing all the right firings, that is after turning on all the right faucets, the Chinese answers pop out at the output end of the series of pipes.\nNow where is the understanding in this system? It takes Chinese as input, it simulates the formal structure of the synapses of the Chinese brain, and it gives Chinese as output. But the man certainly doesn't understand Chinese, and neither do the water pipes, and if we are tempted to adopt what I think is the absurd view that somehow the conjunction of man and water pipes understands, remember that in principle the man can internalize the formal structure of the water pipes and do all the \"neuron firings\" in his imagination.\nTwo variations on the brain simulator reply are the China brain and the brain-replacement scenario.\nWhat if we ask each citizen of China to simulate one neuron, using the telephone system to simulate the connections between axons and dendrites? In this version, it seems obvious that no individual would have any understanding of what the brain might be saying. It is also obvious that this system would be functionally equivalent to a brain, so if consciousness is a function, this system would be conscious.\nIn this, we are asked to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue that there would be no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins. (See Ship of Theseus for a similar thought experiment.)\nClosely related to the brain simulator reply, this claims that a massively parallel connectionist architecture would be capable of understanding.\nThis response combines the robot reply with the brain simulation reply, arguing that a brain simulation connected to the world through a robot body could have a mind.\nBetter technology in the future will allow computers to understand. Searle agrees that this is possible, but considers this point irrelevant. Searle agrees that there may be designs that would cause a machine to have conscious understanding.\nMany mansions / wait till next year reply.\nThese arguments (and the robot or commonsense knowledge replies) identify some special technology that would help create conscious understanding in a machine. They may be interpreted in two ways: either they claim (1) this technology is required for consciousness, the Chinese room does not or cannot implement this technology, and therefore the Chinese room cannot pass the Turing test or (even if it did) it would not have conscious understanding. Or they may be claiming that (2) it is easier to see that the Chinese room has a mind if we visualize this technology as being used to create it.\nIn the first case, where features like a robot body or a connectionist architecture are required, Searle claims that strong AI (as he understands it) has been abandoned. The Chinese room has all the elements of a Turing complete machine, and thus is capable of simulating any digital computation whatsoever. If Searle's room cannot pass the Turing test then there is no other digital technology that could pass the Turing test. If Searle's room \"could\" pass the Turing test, but still does not have a mind, then the Turing test is not sufficient to determine if the room has a \"mind\". Either way, it denies one or the other of the positions Searle thinks of as \"strong AI\", proving his argument.\nThe brain arguments in particular deny strong AI if they assume that there is no simpler way to describe the mind than to create a program that is just as mysterious as the brain was. He writes \"I thought the whole idea of strong AI was that we don't need to know how the brain works to know how the mind works.\" If computation does not provide an \"explanation\" of the human mind, then strong AI has failed, according to Searle.\nOther critics hold that the room as Searle described it does, in fact, have a mind, however they argue that it is difficult to see\u2014Searle's description is correct, but \"misleading.\" By redesigning the room more realistically they hope to make this more obvious. In this case, these arguments are being used as appeals to intuition (see next section).\nIn fact, the room can just as easily be redesigned to \"weaken\" our intuitions. Ned Block's Blockhead argument suggests that the program could, in theory, be rewritten into a simple lookup table of rules of the form \"if the user writes \"S\", reply with \"P\" and goto X\". At least in principle, any program can be rewritten (or \"refactored\") into this form, even a brain simulation. In the blockhead scenario, the entire mental state is hidden in the letter X, which represents a memory address\u2014a number associated with the next rule. It is hard to visualize that an instant of one's conscious experience can be captured in a single large number, yet this is exactly what \"strong AI\" claims. On the other hand, such a lookup table would be ridiculously large (to the point of being physically impossible), and the states could therefore be \"extremely\" specific.\nSearle argues that however the program is written or however the machine is connected to the world, the mind is being \"simulated\" by a simple step-by-step digital machine (or machines). These machines are always just like the man in the room: they understand nothing and do not speak Chinese. They are merely manipulating symbols without knowing what they mean. Searle writes: \"I can have any formal program you like, but I still understand nothing.\"\nSpeed and complexity: appeals to intuition.\nThe following arguments (and the intuitive interpretations of the arguments above) do not directly explain how a Chinese speaking mind could exist in Searle's room, or how the symbols he manipulates could become meaningful. However, by raising doubts about Searle's intuitions they support other positions, such as the system and robot replies. These arguments, if accepted, prevent Searle from claiming that his conclusion is obvious by undermining the intuitions that his certainty requires.\nSeveral critics believe that Searle's argument relies entirely on intuitions. Ned Block writes \"Searle's argument depends for its force on intuitions that certain entities do not think.\" Daniel Dennett describes the Chinese room argument as a misleading \"intuition pump\" and writes \"Searle's thought experiment depends, illicitly, on your imagining too simple a case, an irrelevant case, and drawing the 'obvious' conclusion from it.\"\nSome of the arguments above also function as appeals to intuition, especially those that are intended to make it seem more plausible that the Chinese room contains a mind, which can include the robot, commonsense knowledge, brain simulation and connectionist replies. Several of the replies above also address the specific issue of complexity. The connectionist reply emphasizes that a working artificial intelligence system would have to be as complex and as interconnected as the human brain. The commonsense knowledge reply emphasizes that any program that passed a Turing test would have to be \"an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with 'world knowledge' and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge\", as Daniel Dennett explains.\nMany of these critiques emphasize speed and complexity of the human brain, which processes information at 100 billion operations per second (by some estimates). Several critics point out that the man in the room would probably take millions of years to respond to a simple question, and would require \"filing cabinets\" of astronomical proportions. This brings the clarity of Searle's intuition into doubt.\nAn especially vivid version of the speed and complexity reply is from Paul and Patricia Churchland. They propose this analogous thought experiment: \"Consider a dark room containing a man holding a bar magnet or charged object. If the man pumps the magnet up and down, then, according to Maxwell's theory of artificial luminance (AL), it will initiate a spreading circle of electromagnetic waves and will thus be luminous. But as all of us who have toyed with magnets or charged balls well know, their forces (or any other forces for that matter), even when set in motion produce no luminance at all. It is inconceivable that you might constitute real luminance just by moving forces around!\" Churchland's point is that the problem is that he would have to wave the magnet up and down something like 450 trillion times per second in order to see anything.\nStevan Harnad is critical of speed and complexity replies when they stray beyond addressing our intuitions. He writes \"Some have made a cult of speed and timing, holding that, when accelerated to the right speed, the computational may make a phase transition into the mental. It should be clear that is not a counterargument but merely an \"ad hoc\" speculation (as is the view that it is all just a matter of ratcheting up to the right degree of 'complexity.')\"\nSearle argues that his critics are also relying on intuitions, however his opponents' intuitions have no empirical basis. He writes that, in order to consider the \"system reply\" as remotely plausible, a person must be \"under the grip of an ideology\". The system reply only makes sense (to Searle) if one assumes that any \"system\" can have consciousness, just by virtue of being a system with the right behavior and functional parts. This assumption, he argues, is not tenable given our experience of consciousness.\nOther minds and zombies: meaninglessness.\nSeveral replies argue that Searle's argument is irrelevant because his assumptions about the mind and consciousness are faulty. Searle believes that human beings directly experience their consciousness, intentionality and the nature of the mind every day, and that this experience of consciousness is not open to question. He writes that we must \"presuppose the reality and knowability of the mental.\" The replies below question whether Searle is justified in using his own experience of consciousness to determine that it is more than mechanical symbol processing. In particular, the other minds reply argues that we cannot use our experience of consciousness to answer questions about other minds (even the mind of a computer), the eliminative materialist reply argues that Searle's own personal consciousness does not \"exist\" in the sense that Searle thinks it does, and the epiphenoma replies question whether we can make any argument at all about something like consciousness which can not, by definition, be detected by any experiment.\nThe \"Other Minds Reply\" points out that Searle's argument is a version of the problem of other minds, applied to machines. There is no way we can determine if other people's subjective experience is the same as our own. We can only study their behavior (i.e., by giving them our own Turing test). Critics of Searle argue that he is holding the Chinese room to a higher standard than we would hold an ordinary person.\nNils Nilsson writes \"If a program behaves \"as if\" it were multiplying, most of us would say that it is, in fact, multiplying. For all I know, Searle may only be behaving \"as if\" he were thinking deeply about these matters. But, even though I disagree with him, his simulation is pretty good, so I'm willing to credit him with real thought.\"\nAlan Turing anticipated Searle's line of argument (which he called \"The Argument from Consciousness\") in 1950 and makes the other minds reply. He noted that people never consider the problem of other minds when dealing with each other. He writes that \"instead of arguing continually over this point it is usual to have the polite convention that everyone thinks.\" The Turing test simply extends this \"polite convention\" to machines. He does not intend to solve the problem of other minds (for machines or people) and he does not think we need to.\nSeveral philosophers argue that consciousness, as Searle describes it, does not exist. This position is sometimes referred to as eliminative materialism: the view that consciousness is not a concept that can \"enjoy reduction\" to a strictly mechanical (i.e. material) description, but rather is a concept that will be simply \"eliminated\" once the way the \"material\" brain works is fully understood, in just the same way as the concept of a demon has already been eliminated from science rather than enjoying reduction to a strictly mechanical description, and that our experience of consciousness is, as Daniel Dennett describes it, a \"user illusion\". Other mental properties, such as original intentionality (also called \u201cmeaning\u201d, \u201ccontent\u201d, and \u201csemantic character\u201d), are also commonly regarded as special properties related to beliefs and other propositional attitudes. Eliminative materialism maintains that propositional attitudes such as beliefs and desires, among other intentional mental states that have content, do not exist. If eliminative materialism is the correct scientific account of human cognition then the assumption of the Chinese room argument that \"minds have mental contents (semantics)\" must be rejected.\nStuart Russell and Peter Norvig argue that if we accept Searle's description of intentionality, consciousness, and the mind, we are forced to accept that consciousness is epiphenomenal: that it \"casts no shadow\" i.e. is undetectable in the outside world. They argue that Searle must be mistaken about the \"knowability of the mental\", and in his belief that there are \"causal properties\" in our neurons that give rise to the mind. They point out that, by Searle's own description, these causal properties cannot be detected by anyone outside the mind, otherwise the Chinese Room could not pass the Turing test\u2014the people outside would be able to tell there was not a Chinese speaker in the room by detecting their causal properties. Since they cannot detect causal properties, they cannot detect the existence of the mental. In short, Searle's \"causal properties\" and consciousness itself is undetectable, and anything that cannot be detected either does not exist or does not matter.\nMike Alder makes the same point, which he calls the \"Newton's Flaming Laser Sword Reply\". He argues that the entire argument is frivolous, because it is non-verificationist: not only is the distinction between \"simulating\" a mind and \"having\" a mind ill-defined, but it is also irrelevant because no experiments were, or even can be, proposed to distinguish between the two.\nDaniel Dennett provides this extension to the \"epiphenomena\" argument. Suppose that, by some mutation, a human being is born that does not have Searle's \"causal properties\" but nevertheless acts exactly like a human being. (This sort of animal is called a \"zombie\" in thought experiments in the philosophy of mind). This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it is most likely that human beings (as we see them today) are actually \"zombies\", who nevertheless insist they are conscious. It is impossible to know whether we are all zombies or not. Even if we are all zombies, we would still believe that we are not.\nSearle disagrees with this analysis and argues that \"the study of the mind starts with such facts as that humans have beliefs, while thermostats, telephones, and adding machines don't ... what we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers.\" He takes it as obvious that we can detect the presence of consciousness and dismisses these replies as being off the point.\nOther replies.\nMargaret Boden argued in her paper \"Escaping from the Chinese Room\" that even if the person in the room does not understand the Chinese, it does not mean there is no understanding in the room. The person in the room at least understands the rule book used to provide output responses.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Chinese room argument is a central concept in Peter Watts's novels \"Blindsight\" and (to a lesser extent) \"Echopraxia\". Greg Egan illustrates the concept succinctly (and somewhat horrifically) in his 1990 short story \"Learning to Be Me,\" in his collection \"Axiomatic\".\nIt is a central theme in the video game \"\", and ties into the game's narrative. \nA similar human computer is imagined in Liu Cixin's novel \"The Three-Body Problem\", described thus by Philip Steiner: \"a massive human-computer by instrumentalizing millions of soldiers [who] take the role of signal input and signal output and are instructed to perform different logical circuits, like an AND gate and an OR gate\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Page numbers above refer to a standard PDF print of the article.\"\n\"Page numbers above refer to a standard PDF print of the article.\"\n\"Page numbers above refer to a standard PDF print of the article.\"\n\"Page numbers above refer to a standard PDF print of the article.\"\n\"Page numbers above refer to a standard PDF print of the article.

{"id": "6220", "revid": "166386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6220", "title": "Circle", "text": "Simple curve of Euclidean geometry\nA circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre. The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius. Usually, the radius is required to be a positive number. A circle with formula_1 (a single point) is a degenerate case. This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.\nSpecifically, a circle is a simple closed curve that divides the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior. In everyday use, the term \"circle\" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a \"disc\".\nA circle may also be defined as a special kind of ellipse in which the two foci are coincident, the eccentricity is 0, and the semi-major and semi-minor axes are equal; or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, using calculus of variations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEuclid's definition.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A circle is a plane figure bounded by one curved line, and such that all straight lines drawn from a certain point within it to the bounding line, are equal. The bounding line is called its circumference and the point, its centre.\nTopological definition.\nIn the field of topology, a circle is not limited to the geometric concept, but to all of its homeomorphisms. Two topological circles are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R3 upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy).\nTerminology.\nAll of the specified regions may be considered as \"open\", that is, not containing their boundaries, or as \"closed\", including their respective boundaries.\nHistory.\nThe word \"circle\" derives from the Greek \u03ba\u03af\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2/\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (\"kirkos/kuklos\"), itself a metathesis of the Homeric Greek \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 (\"krikos\"), meaning \"hoop\" or \"ring\". The origins of the words \"circus\" and \"circuit\" are closely related.\nThe circle has been known since before the beginning of recorded history. Natural circles would have been observed, such as the Moon, Sun, and a short plant stalk blowing in the wind on sand, which forms a circle shape in the sand. The circle is the basis for the wheel, which, with related inventions such as gears, makes much of modern machinery possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry, astronomy and calculus.\nEarly science, particularly geometry and astrology and astronomy, was connected to the divine for most medieval scholars, and many believed that there was something intrinsically \"divine\" or \"perfect\" that could be found in circles.\nSome highlights in the history of the circle are:\nAnalytic results.\nCircumference.\nThe ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is \u03c0 (pi), an irrational constant approximately equal to 3.141592654. Thus the circumference \"C\" is related to the radius \"r\" and diameter \"d\" by:\nformula_2\nArea enclosed.\nAs proved by Archimedes, in his Measurement of a Circle, the area enclosed by a circle is equal to that of a triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, which comes to \u03c0 multiplied by the radius squared:\nformula_3\nEquivalently, denoting diameter by \"d\",\nformula_4\nthat is, approximately 79% of the circumscribing square (whose side is of length \"d\").\nThe circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length. This relates the circle to a problem in the calculus of variations, namely the isoperimetric inequality.\nEquations.\nCartesian coordinates.\nIn an \"x\"\u2013\"y\" Cartesian coordinate system, the circle with centre coordinates (\"a\", \"b\") and radius \"r\" is the set of all points (\"x\", \"y\") such that\n formula_5\nThis equation, known as the \"equation of the circle\", follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the adjacent diagram, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length |\"x\" \u2212 \"a\"| and |\"y\" \u2212 \"b\"|. If the circle is centred at the origin (0,\u00a00), then the equation simplifies to\n formula_6\nThe equation can be written in parametric form using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine as\n formula_7\n formula_8\nwhere \"t\" is a parametric variable in the range 0 to 2\u03c0, interpreted geometrically as the angle that the ray from (\"a\",\u00a0\"b\") to (\"x\",\u00a0\"y\") makes with the positive \"x\"\u00a0axis.\nAn alternative parametrisation of the circle is\n formula_9\n formula_10\nIn this parameterisation, the ratio of \"t\" to \"r\" can be interpreted geometrically as the stereographic projection of the line passing through the centre parallel to the \"x\"\u00a0axis (see Tangent half-angle substitution). However, this parameterisation works only if \"t\" is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the leftmost point of the circle would be omitted.\nThe equation of the circle determined by three points formula_11 not on a line is obtained by a conversion of the \"3-point form of a circle equation\":\n formula_12\nIn homogeneous coordinates, each conic section with the equation of a circle has the form\n formula_13\nIt can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the complex projective plane) the points \"I\"(1: \"i\": 0) and \"J\"(1:\u00a0\u2212\"i\":\u00a00). These points are called the circular points at infinity.\nPolar coordinates.\nIn polar coordinates, the equation of a circle is\n formula_14\nwhere \"a\" is the radius of the circle, formula_15 are the polar coordinates of a generic point on the circle, and formula_16 are the polar coordinates of the centre of the circle (i.e., \"r\"0 is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and \"\u03c6\" is the anticlockwise angle from the positive \"x\"\u00a0axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred on the origin, i.e. \"r\"0 \n 0, this reduces to \"r\" \n \"a\". When \"r\"0 \n \"a\", or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes\n formula_17\nIn the general case, the equation can be solved for \"r\", giving\n formula_18\nNote that without the \u00b1 sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.\nComplex plane.\nIn the complex plane, a circle with a centre at \"c\" and radius \"r\" has the equation\n formula_19\nIn parametric form, this can be written as\n formula_20\nThe slightly generalised equation\n formula_21\nfor real \"p\", \"q\" and complex \"g\" is sometimes called a generalised circle. This becomes the above equation for a circle with formula_22, since formula_23. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a line.\nTangent lines.\nThe tangent line through a point \"P\" on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through \"P\". If P \n (\"x\"1, \"y\"1) and the circle has centre (\"a\", \"b\") and radius \"r\", then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (\"a\", \"b\") to (\"x\"1, \"y\"1), so it has the form (\"x\"1 \u2212 \"a\")\"x\" + (\"y\"1 \u2013 \"b\")\"y\" \n \"c\". Evaluating at (\"x\"1, \"y\"1) determines the value of \"c\", and the result is that the equation of the tangent is\n formula_24\nor\n formula_25\nIf \"y\"1 \u2260 \"b\", then the slope of this line is\n formula_26\nThis can also be found using implicit differentiation.\nWhen the centre of the circle is at the origin, then the equation of the tangent line becomes\n formula_27\nand its slope is\n formula_28\nProperties.\nChord.\n \"cd\".\nTangent.\n arc(\"AQ\").\nTheorems.\n \"AB\" \u00d7 \"AE\".\n \"AB\" \u00d7 \"AE\" (corollary of the chord theorem).\n \"AC\" \u00d7 \"AD\" (tangent\u2013secant theorem).\n \"r\" \u221a2, where \"\u2113\" is the length of the chord, and \"r\" is the radius of the circle.\nInscribed angles.\nAn inscribed angle (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding central angle (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a diameter is a right angle (since the central angle is 180\u00b0).\nSagitta.\nThe sagitta (also known as the versine) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.\nGiven the length \"y\" of a chord and the length \"x\" of the sagitta, the Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle that will fit around the two lines:\n formula_32\nAnother proof of this result, which relies only on two chord properties given above, is as follows. Given a chord of length \"y\" and with sagitta of length \"x\", since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know that it is a part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the \"missing\" part of the diameter is (2\"r\" \u2212 \"x\") in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that (2\"r\" \u2212 \"x\")\"x\" \n (\"y\" / 2)2. Solving for \"r\", we find the required result.\nCompass and straightedge constructions.\nThere are many compass-and-straightedge constructions resulting in circles.\nThe simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the compass on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.\nCircle of Apollonius.\nApollonius of Perga showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in a plane having a constant \"ratio\" (other than 1) of distances to two fixed foci, \"A\" and \"B\". (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment \"AB\", a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn \"about\" two points.\nThe proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci \"A\" and \"B\" and a ratio of distances, any point \"P\" satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let \"C\" be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment \"AB\". By the angle bisector theorem the line segment \"PC\" will bisect the interior angle \"APB\", since the segments are similar:\nformula_33\nAnalogously, a line segment \"PD\" through some point \"D\" on \"AB\" extended bisects the corresponding exterior angle \"BPQ\" where \"Q\" is on \"AP\" extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle \"CPD\" is exactly 90 degrees; that is, a right angle. The set of points \"P\" such that angle \"CPD\" is a right angle forms a circle, of which \"CD\" is a diameter.\nSecond, see for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.\nCross-ratios.\nA closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the cross-ratio of points in the complex plane. If \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points \"P\" for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:\n formula_34\nStated another way, \"P\" is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [\"A\", \"B\"; \"C\", \"P\"] is on the unit circle in the complex plane.\nGeneralised circles.\nIf \"C\" is the midpoint of the segment \"AB\", then the collection of points \"P\" satisfying the Apollonius condition\nformula_35\u00a0\nis not a circle, but rather a line.\nThus, if \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points \"P\" satisfying the above equation is called a \"generalised circle.\" It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a line is a generalised circle of infinite radius.\nInscription in or circumscription about other figures.\nIn every triangle a unique circle, called the incircle, can be inscribed such that it is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle.\nAbout every triangle a unique circle, called the circumcircle, can be circumscribed such that it goes through each of the triangle's three vertices.\nA tangential polygon, such as a tangential quadrilateral, is any convex polygon within which a circle can be inscribed that is tangent to each side of the polygon. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a tangential polygon.\nA cyclic polygon is any convex polygon about which a circle can be circumscribed, passing through each vertex. A well-studied example is the cyclic quadrilateral. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a bicentric polygon.\nA hypocycloid is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.\nLimiting case of other figures.\nThe circle can be viewed as a limiting case of each of various other figures:\n \"a\". A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which \"n\" \n 2.\nIn other \"p\"-norms.\nDefining a circle as the set of points with a fixed distance from a point, different shapes can be considered circles under different definitions of distance. In \"p\"-norm, distance is determined by\nformula_37\nIn Euclidean geometry, \"p\" = 2, giving the familiar\nformula_38\nIn taxicab geometry, \"p\" = 1. Taxicab circles are squares with sides oriented at a 45\u00b0 angle to the coordinate axes. While each side would have length formula_39 using a Euclidean metric, where \"r\" is the circle's radius, its length in taxicab geometry is 2\"r\". Thus, a circle's circumference is 8\"r\". Thus, the value of a geometric analog to formula_40 is 4 in this geometry. The formula for the unit circle in taxicab geometry is formula_41 in Cartesian coordinates and\nformula_42\nin polar coordinates.\nA circle of radius 1 (using this distance) is the von Neumann neighborhood of its centre.\nA circle of radius \"r\" for the Chebyshev distance (L\u221e metric) on a plane is also a square with side length 2\"r\" parallel to the coordinate axes, so planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to planar taxicab distance. However, this equivalence between L1 and L\u221e metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions.\nLocus of constant sum.\nConsider a finite set of formula_43 points in the plane. The locus of points such that the sum of the squares of the distances to the given points is constant is a circle, whose centre is at the centroid of the given points.\nA generalization for higher powers of distances is obtained if under formula_43 points the vertices of the regular polygon formula_45 are taken. The locus of points such that the sum of the formula_46-th power of distances formula_47 to the vertices of a given regular polygon with circumradius formula_48 is constant is a circle, if\nformula_49, where formula_50=1,2,\u2026, formula_43-1;\nwhose centre is the centroid of the formula_45.\nIn the case of the equilateral triangle, the loci of the constant sums of the second and fourth powers are circles, whereas for the square, the loci are circles for the constant sums of the second, fourth, and sixth powers. For the regular pentagon the constant sum of the eighth powers of the distances will be added and so forth.\nSquaring the circle.\nSquaring the circle is the problem, proposed by ancient geometers, of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge.\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem, which proves that pi (\u03c0) is a transcendental number, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. Despite the impossibility, this topic continues to be of interest for pseudomath enthusiasts.\nSignificance in art and symbolism.\nFrom the time of the earliest known civilisations \u2013 such as the Assyrians and ancient Egyptians, those in the Indus Valley and along the Yellow River in China, and the Western civilisations of ancient Greece and Rome during classical Antiquity \u2013 the circle has been used directly or indirectly in visual art to convey the artist's message and to express certain ideas.\nHowever, differences in worldview (beliefs and culture) had a great impact on artists\u2019 perceptions. While some emphasised the circle's perimeter to demonstrate their democratic manifestation, others focused on its centre to symbolise the concept of cosmic unity. In mystical doctrines, the circle mainly symbolises the infinite and cyclical nature of existence, but in religious traditions it represents heavenly bodies and divine spirits.\nThe circle signifies many sacred and spiritual concepts, including unity, infinity, wholeness, the universe, divinity, balance, stability and perfection, among others. Such concepts have been conveyed in cultures worldwide through the use of symbols, for example, a compass, a halo, the vesica piscis and its derivatives (fish, eye, aureole, mandorla, etc.), the ouroboros, the Dharma wheel, a rainbow, mandalas, rose windows and so forth.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6221", "revid": "27738727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6221", "title": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)", "text": "Senior church official\nA cardinal (, lit.\u2009'cardinal of the Holy Roman Church') is a senior member of the clergy of the Catholic Church. Cardinals are created by the current pope and typically hold the title for life. Collectively, they constitute the College of Cardinals.\nThe most solemn responsibility of the cardinals is to elect a new pope in a conclave, almost always from among themselves (with a few historical exceptions), when the Holy See is vacant. During the period between a pope's death or resignation and the election of his successor, the day-to-day governance of the Holy See is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. The right to participate in a conclave is limited to cardinals who have not reached the age of 80 years by the day the vacancy occurs. In addition, cardinals collectively participate in papal consistories (which generally take place annually), in which matters of importance to the Church are considered and new cardinals may be created. Cardinals of working age are also appointed to roles overseeing dicasteries of the Roman Curia, the central administration of the Catholic Church.\nCardinals are drawn from a variety of backgrounds, being appointed as cardinals \"in addition\" to their existing roles within the Church. Most cardinals are bishops and archbishops leading dioceses and archdioceses around the world \u2013 often the most prominent diocese or archdiocese in their country. Others are titular bishops who are current or former officials within the Roman Curia (generally the leaders of dicasteries and other bodies linked with the Curia). A very small number are priests recognised by the pope for their service to the Church; as canon law requires them to be generally consecrated as bishops before they are made cardinals, but some are granted a papal dispensation. There are no strict criteria for elevation to the College of Cardinals. Since 1917, a potential cardinal must already be at least a priest, but laymen have been cardinals in the past. The selection is entirely up to the pope and tradition is his only guide.\n there are serving cardinals, of whom are eligible to vote in a conclave to elect a new pope.\nHistory.\nThere is general disagreement about the origin of the term, but a chief consensus that \"cardinalis\" is etymologically from the Latin word (meaning \"pivot\" or \"hinge\") was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained. In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean \"principal\", \"eminent\", or \"superior\". The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \"title\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become Bishop of Rome. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244.\nIn cities other than Rome, the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour. The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by Pope Zacharias in 747 to Pippin III (the Short), ruler of the Franks, in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of Paris to distinguish them from country clergy. This meaning of the word spread rapidly, and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals. The use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of Rome in 1567 by Pius V.\nIn 1059 (five years after the East-West Schism), the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven suburbicarian sees. In the 12th century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began, with each of them assigned a church in Rome as his titular church or linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses, while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome.\nThe term \"cardinal\" at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or incardinated to a church, or specifically to the senior priest of an important church, based on the Latin \"cardo\" (hinge), meaning \"pivotal\" as in \"principal\" or \"chief\". The term was applied in this sense as early as the 9th century to the priests of the \"tituli\" (parishes) of the diocese of Rome.\nIn the year 1563, the Ecumenical Council of Trent, headed by Pope Pius IV, wrote about the importance of selecting good cardinals: \"nothing is more necessary to the Church of God than that the holy Roman pontiff apply that solicitude which by the duty of his office he owes the universal Church in a very special way by associating with himself as cardinals the most select persons only, and appoint to each church most eminently upright and competent shepherds; and this the more so, because our Lord Jesus Christ will require at his hands the blood of the sheep of Christ that perish through the evil government of shepherds who are negligent and forgetful of their office.\"\nThe earlier influence of temporal rulers, notably the Kings of France, reasserted itself through the influence of cardinals of certain nationalities or politically significant movements. Traditions even developed entitling certain monarchs, including those of Austria, Spain, and France, to nominate one of their trusted clerical subjects to be created cardinal, a so-called \"crown-cardinal\".\nIn early modern times, cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs. In some cases, they took on powerful positions in government. In Henry VIII's England, his chief minister was for some time Cardinal Wolsey. Cardinal Richelieu's power was so great that he was for many years effectively the ruler of France. Richelieu's successor was also a cardinal, Jules Mazarin. Guillaume Dubois and Andr\u00e9-Hercule de Fleury complete the list of the four great cardinals to have ruled France. In Portugal, due to a succession crisis, one cardinal, Henry of Portugal, was crowned king, the only example of a cardinal-king.\nWhile the incumbents of some sees are regularly made cardinals, and some countries are entitled to at least one cardinal by concordate (usually earning either its primate or the metropolitan of the capital city the cardinal's hat), almost no see carries an actual right to the cardinalate, not even if its bishop is a Patriarch: the notable exception is the Patriarch of Lisbon who, by Pope Clement XII's 1737 bull \"Inter praecipuas apostolici ministerii\", is accorded the right to be elevated to the rank of cardinal in the consistory following his appointment.\nPapal elections.\nIn 1059, Pope Nicholas II gave cardinals the right to elect the Bishop of Rome in the papal bull \"In nomine Domini\". For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but in 1179 the Third Lateran Council restored the right to the whole body of cardinals.\nNumbers.\nIn 1586, Pope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70: six cardinal bishops, 50 cardinal priests, and 14 cardinal deacons. Pope John XXIII exceeded that limit citing the need to staff Church offices. In November 1970 in \"Ingravescentem aetatem\", Pope Paul VI established that electors would be under the age of eighty years. When it took effect on 1 January 1971, it deprived twenty-five cardinals of the right to participate in a conclave. In October 1975 in \"Romano Pontifici eligendo\", he set the maximum number of electors at 120, while establishing no limit on the overall size of the college.\nPopes can set aside church laws and they have regularly brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120, twice reaching as high as 135 with Pope John Paul II's consistories of February 2001 and October 2003. No more than 120 electors have ever participated in a conclave, but most canon lawyers believe that if their number exceeded 120 they would all participate.\nPope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by assigning that rank, in 1965, to patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches when named cardinals. In 2018, Pope Francis expanded the cardinal bishops of Roman title, because this had not been done despite recent decades' expansion in the two lower orders of cardinals, besides having all six such cardinals being over the age limit for a conclave.\nTitular churches.\nEach cardinal is assigned a titular church upon his creation, which is always a church in the city of Rome. Through the process of opting (\"optazione\"), a cardinal can raise through the ranks from cardinal deacon to priest, and from cardinal priest to that of cardinal bishop - in which case he obtains one of the suburbicarian sees located around the city of Rome. The only exception is for patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches. Nevertheless, cardinals possess no power of governance nor are they to intervene in any way in matters which pertain to the administration of goods, discipline, or the service of their titular churches. They are allowed to celebrate Mass and hear confessions and lead visits and pilgrimages to their titular churches, in coordination with the staff of the church. They often support their churches monetarily, and many cardinals do keep in contact with the pastoral staffs of their titular churches. The term cardinal is from the Latin word \"cardo\" meaning a hinge. Here it means a \"door\", an example of synecdoche, a figure of speech whereby the part refers to the whole. The \"door\" is the address of the titular church from which the cardinal derives his membership of the Roman clergy, who elect the pope.\nThe Dean of the College of Cardinals in addition to such a titular church also receives the titular bishopric of Ostia, the primary suburbicarian see. Cardinals governing a particular church retain that church.\nTitle and reference style.\nIn 1630, Pope Urban VIII decreed their title to be \"Eminence\" (previously, it had been \"illustrissimo\" and \"reverendissimo\") and decreed that their secular rank would equate to Prince, making them secondary only to the pope and crowned monarchs.\nIn accordance with tradition, they sign by placing the title \"Cardinal\" (abbreviated \"Card.\") after their personal name and before their surname as, for instance, \"John Card(inal) Doe\" or, in Latin, \"Ioannes Card(inalis) Doe\". Some writers, such as James-Charles Noonan, hold that, in the case of cardinals, the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them in English. However, official sources, such as the Catholic News Service, say that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is normally as \"Cardinal [First name] [Surname]\". This is the rule given also in stylebooks not associated with the church. This style is also generally followed on the websites of the Holy See and episcopal conferences. Oriental patriarchs who are created cardinals customarily use \"Sanctae Ecclesiae Cardinalis\" as their full title, probably because they do not belong to the Roman clergy.\nThe [First name] Cardinal [Surname] order is used in the Latin proclamation of the election of a new pope by the cardinal protodeacon, if the new pope is a cardinal, as it has been since 1378.\nThe term Prince of the Church has historically been applied to cardinals of the Catholic church, and sometimes more broadly to senior members of the church hierarchy. It has been rejected by Pope Francis, who stated to a group of newly created cardinals \"He (Jesus) does not call you to become 'princes' of the Church, to 'sit on his right or on his left.' He calls you to serve like Him and with Him.\" The term is still applied, both seriously and as a criticism of their perceived attitudes of some cardinals \nOrders and their chief offices.\nCardinal bishops.\nCardinal bishops (cardinals of the episcopal order; ) are the senior order of cardinals. Though in modern times the vast majority of cardinals are also bishops or archbishops, few are \"cardinal bishops\". For most of the second millennium there were six cardinal bishops, each presiding over one of the seven suburbicarian sees around Rome: Ostia, Albano, Porto and Santa Rufina, Palestrina, Sabina and Mentana, Frascati, and Velletri. Velletri was united with Ostia from 1150 until 1914, when Pope Pius X separated them again, but decreed that whichever cardinal bishop became Dean of the College of Cardinals would keep the suburbicarian see he already held, adding to it that of Ostia, with the result that there continued to be only six cardinal bishops. Since 1962, the cardinal bishops have only a titular relationship with the suburbicarian sees, each of which is governed by a separate ordinary.\nUntil 1961, membership in the order of cardinal bishops was achieved through precedence in the College of Cardinals. When a suburbicarian see fell vacant, the most senior cardinal by precedence could exercise his option to claim the see and be promoted to the order of cardinal bishops. Pope John XXIII abolished that privilege on 10 March 1961 and made the right to promote someone to the order of cardinal bishops the sole prerogative of the pope.\nIn 1965, Pope Paul VI decreed in his \"motu proprio\" \"Ad purpuratorum Patrum Collegium\" that patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches who were named cardinals (i.e. \"cardinal patriarchs\") would also be cardinal bishops, ranking after the six Roman rite cardinal bishops of the suburbicarian sees. (Latin Church patriarchs who become cardinals are cardinal priests, not cardinal bishops: for example Angelo Scola was made Patriarch of Venice in 2002 and cardinal priest of Santi XII Apostoli in 2003.) Those of cardinal patriarch rank continue to hold their patriarchal see and are not assigned any Roman title (suburbicarian see or title or deaconry).\nAt the June 2018 consistory, Pope Francis increased the number of Latin Church cardinal bishops to match the expansion in cardinal priests and cardinal deacons in recent decades. He elevated four cardinals to this rank granting their titular churches and deaconries suburbicarian rank \"pro hac vice\" (temporarily) and making them equivalent to suburbicarian see titles. At the time of the announcement, all six cardinal bishops of suburbicarian see titles, as well as two of the three cardinal patriarchs, were non-electors because of having reached age 80. Pope Francis created another cardinal bishop in the same way on 1 May 2020, bringing the number of Latin Church cardinal bishops to eleven.\nThe Dean of the College of Cardinals, the highest ranking cardinal, was formerly the longest serving cardinal bishop, but since 1965 is elected by the Latin Church cardinal bishops from among their number, subject to papal approval. Likewise the Vice-Dean, formerly the second longest serving, is also elected. Seniority of the remaining Latin Church cardinal bishops is still by date of appointment to the rank. For a period ending in the mid-20th century, long-serving cardinal priests were entitled to fill vacancies that arose among the cardinal bishops, just as cardinal deacons of ten years' standing are still entitled to become cardinal priests.\nCardinal priests.\nCardinal priests () are the most numerous of the three orders of cardinals in the Catholic Church, ranking above the cardinal deacons and below the cardinal bishops. Those who are named cardinal priests today are generally also bishops of important dioceses throughout the world, though some hold Curial positions.\nIn modern times, the name \"cardinal priest\" is interpreted as meaning a cardinal who is of the order of priests. Originally, however, this referred to certain key priests of important churches of the Diocese of Rome, who were recognized as the \"cardinal\" priests, the important priests chosen by the pope to advise him in his duties as Bishop of Rome (the Latin \"cardo\" means \"hinge\"). Certain clerics in many dioceses at the time, not just that of Rome, were said to be the key personnel\u2014the term gradually became exclusive to Rome to indicate those entrusted with electing the Bishop of Rome, the pope.\nWhile the cardinalate has long been expanded beyond the Roman pastoral clergy and Roman Curia, every cardinal priest has a titular church in Rome, though they may be bishops or archbishops elsewhere, just as cardinal bishops were given one of the suburbicarian dioceses around Rome. Pope Paul VI abolished all administrative rights cardinals had with regard to their titular churches, though the cardinal's name and coat of arms are still posted in the church, and they are expected to celebrate Mass and preach there if convenient when they are in Rome.\nWhile the number of cardinals was small from the times of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance, and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest, in the 16th century the college expanded markedly. In 1587, Pope Sixtus V sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the college at 70, including 50 cardinal priests, about twice the historical number. This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally when a building fell into disrepair. When Pope John XXIII abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do. Today there are close to 150 titular churches, out of over 300 churches in Rome.\nThe cardinal who is the longest-serving member of the order of cardinal priests is titled \"cardinal protopriest\". He had certain ceremonial duties in the conclave that have effectively ceased because he would generally have already reached age 80, at which cardinals are barred from the conclave. The current cardinal protopriest is Michael Michai Kitbunchu of Thailand.\nCardinal deacons.\nThe cardinal deacons () are the lowest-ranking cardinals. Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are either officials of the Roman Curia or priests elevated after their 80th birthday. Bishops with diocesan responsibilities, however, are created cardinal priests.\nCardinal deacons derive originally from the seven deacons in the Papal Household who supervised the Church's works in the seven districts of Rome during the early Middle Ages, when church administration was effectively the government of Rome and provided all social services. They came to be called \"cardinal deacons\" by the late eighth century, and they were granted active rights in papal elections and made eligible for the election as pope by the decree of 769.\nCardinals elevated to the diaconal order are mainly officials of the Roman Curia holding various posts in the church administration. Their number and influence has varied through the years. While historically predominantly Italian the group has become much more internationally diverse in later years. While in 1939 about half were Italian by 1994 the number was reduced to one third. Their influence in the election of the pope has been considered important. They are better informed and connected than the dislocated cardinals but their level of unity has been varied. Under the 1587 decree of Pope Sixtus V, which fixed the maximum size of the College of Cardinals, there were 14 cardinal deacons. Later the number increased. As late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the curia. Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent. John XXIII brought it back up to 37 percent but Paul VI brought it down to 27 percent where John Paul II maintained this ratio.\nAs of 2005, there were over 50 churches recognized as cardinalatial deaconries, though there were only 30 cardinals of the order of deacons. Cardinal deacons have long enjoyed the right to \"opt for the order of cardinal priests\" (\"optazione\") after they have been cardinal deacons for 10 years. They may on such elevation take a vacant \"title\" (a church allotted to a cardinal priest as the church in Rome with which he is associated) or their diaconal church may be temporarily elevated to a cardinal priest's \"title\" for that occasion. When elevated to cardinal priests, they take their precedence according to the day they were first made cardinal deacons (thus ranking above cardinal priests who were elevated to the college after them, regardless of order).\nWhen not celebrating Mass but still serving a liturgical function, such as the semiannual \"Urbi et Orbi\" papal blessing, some Papal Masses and some events at Ecumenical Councils, cardinal deacons can be recognized by the dalmatics they would don with the simple white mitre (so called \"mitra simplex\").\nCardinal protodeacon.\nThe cardinal protodeacon is the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals. If he is a cardinal elector and participates in a conclave, he announces a new pope's election and name from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. The protodeacon also bestows the pallium on the new pope and crowns him with the papal tiara, although the crowning has not been celebrated since Pope John Paul I opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony in 1978. The current cardinal protodeacon is Renato Raffaele Martino.\nSpecial types of cardinals.\nCamerlengo.\nThe Cardinal Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, assisted by the Vice-Camerlengo and the other prelates of the office known as the Apostolic Camera, has functions that in essence are limited to a period of \"sede vacante\" of the papacy. He is to collate information about the financial situation of all administrations dependent on the Holy See and present the results to the College of Cardinals, as they gather for the papal conclave.\nCardinals who are not bishops.\nUntil 1918, any cleric, even one only in minor orders, could be created a cardinal (see \"lay cardinals\", below), but enrolled only in the order of cardinal deacons. For example, in the 16th century, Reginald Pole was a cardinal for 18 years before he was ordained a priest. The 1917 Code of Canon Law mandated that all cardinals, even cardinal deacons, had to be priests, and, in 1962, Pope John XXIII set the norm that all cardinals be consecrated as bishops, even if they are only priests at the time of appointment. As a consequence of these two changes, canon 351 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law requires that a cardinal be at least in the order of priesthood at his appointment, and that those who are not already bishops must receive episcopal consecration. Several cardinals near to or over the age of 80 or when appointed have obtained dispensation from the rule of having to be a bishop. These were all appointed cardinal-deacons, but Roberto Tucci and Albert Vanhoye lived long enough to exercise the right of option and be promoted to the rank of cardinal-priest.\nA cardinal who is not a bishop is entitled to wear and use the episcopal vestments and other pontificalia (episcopal regalia: mitre, crozier, zucchetto, pectoral cross, and ring). He has both actual and honorary precedence over patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops who are not cardinals. However, he cannot perform the sacrament of ordination or other rites reserved solely to bishops. The prominent priests who since 1962 were not ordained bishops on their elevation to the cardinalate were over the age of 80 or near to it, and so no cardinal who was not a bishop has participated in recent papal conclaves.\n\"Lay cardinals\".\nAt various times, there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests. Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \"lay cardinals\". Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals. Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.\nCardinals \"in pectore\" or secret cardinals.\nIn addition to the named cardinals, the pope may name secret cardinals or cardinals \"in pectore\" (Latin for \"in the breast\"). During the Western Schism, many cardinals were created by the contending popes. Beginning with the reign of Pope Martin V, cardinals were created without publishing their names until later, a practice termed \"creati et reservati in pectore\". A cardinal named \"in pectore\" is known only to the pope. In the modern era, popes have named cardinals \"in pectore\" to protect them or their congregations from political reprisals. If conditions change, the pope makes the appointment public. The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those made cardinals at the time of his \"in pectore\" appointment. If a pope dies before revealing the identity of an \"in pectore\" cardinal, the person's status as cardinal expires. The last pope known to have named a cardinal \"in pectore\" is Pope John Paul II, who named four, including one whose identity was never revealed.\nVesture and privileges.\nWhen in choir dress, a Latin Church cardinal wears scarlet garments\u2014the blood-like red symbolizes a cardinal's willingness to die for his faith. Excluding the rochet \u2014 which is always white\u2014the scarlet garments include the cassock, mozzetta, and biretta (over the usual scarlet zucchetto). The biretta of a cardinal is distinctive not merely for its scarlet color, but also for the fact that it does not have a pompon or tassel on the top as do the birettas of other prelates. Until the 1460s, it was customary for cardinals to wear a violet or blue cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business. His normal-wear cassock is black but has scarlet piping and a scarlet fascia (sash). Occasionally, a cardinal wears a scarlet \"ferraiolo\" which is a cape worn over the shoulders, tied at the neck in a bow by narrow strips of cloth in the front, without any 'trim' or piping on it. It is because of the scarlet color of cardinals' vesture that the bird of the same name has become known as such.\nEastern Catholic cardinals continue to wear the normal dress appropriate to their liturgical tradition, though some may line their cassocks with scarlet and wear scarlet fascias, or in some cases, wear Eastern-style cassocks entirely of scarlet.\nIn previous times, at the consistory at which the pope named a new cardinal, he would bestow upon him a distinctive wide-brimmed hat called a galero. This custom was discontinued in 1969 and the investiture now takes place with the scarlet biretta. In ecclesiastical heraldry, however, the scarlet galero is still displayed on the cardinal's coat of arms. Cardinals had the right to display the galero in their cathedral, and when a cardinal died, it would be suspended from the ceiling above his tomb. Some cardinals will still have a galero made, even though it is not officially part of their apparel.\nTo symbolize their bond with the papacy, the pope gives each newly appointed cardinal a gold ring, which is traditionally kissed by Catholics when greeting a cardinal (as with a bishop's episcopal ring). Before the new uniformity imposed by John Paul II, each cardinal was given a ring, the central piece of which was a gem, usually a sapphire, with the pope's stemma engraved on the inside. There is now no gemstone, and the pope chooses the image on the outside: under Pope Benedict XVI it was a modern depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus, with Mary and John to each side. The ring includes the pope's coat of arms on the inside.\nCardinals have in canon law a \"privilege of forum\" (i.e., exemption from being judged by ecclesiastical tribunals of ordinary rank): only the pope is competent to judge them in matters subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction (cases that refer to matters that are spiritual or linked with the spiritual, or with regard to infringement of ecclesiastical laws and whatever contains an element of sin, where culpability must be determined and the appropriate\necclesiastical penalty imposed). The pope either decides the case himself or delegates the decision to a tribunal, usually one of the tribunals or congregations of the Roman Curia. Without such delegation, no ecclesiastical court, even the Roman Rota, is competent to judge a canon law case against a cardinal.\nAdditionally, canon law gives cardinals the faculty of hearing confessions validly and licitly everywhere, whereas other priests and bishops must be granted this faculty and might be restricted in its use by the local bishop.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "6225", "revid": "494861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6225", "title": "Cantigas de Santa Maria", "text": "Collection of Galician canticles (songs with music), preserved in several manuscripts\nThe Cantigas de Santa Maria (], Portuguese:\u00a0]; \"Canticles of Holy Mary\") are 420 poems with musical notation, written in the medieval Galician-Portuguese language during the reign of Alfonso X of Castile \"El Sabio\" (1221\u20131284). Traditionally, they are all attributed to Alfonso, though scholars have since established that the musicians and poets of his court were responsible for most of them, with Alfonso being credited with a few as well.\nIt is one of the largest collections of monophonic (solo) songs from the Middle Ages and is characterized by the mention of the Virgin Mary in every song, while every tenth song is a hymn.\nThe \"Cantigas\" have survived in four manuscript codices: two at El Escorial, one at Madrid's National Library, and one in Florence, Italy. The E codex from El Escorial is illuminated with colored miniatures showing pairs of musicians playing a wide variety of instruments. The \"C\u00f3dice Rico\" (T) from El Escorial and the one in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale of Florence (F) are richly illuminated with narrative vignettes.\nDescription.\nThe Cantigas are written in the early Medieval Galician variety of Galician-Portuguese, using Galician spelling; this was because of Galician-Portuguese being fashionable as a lyrical language in Castile at the time, as well as Alfonso X having passed part of his early years in Galicia and so probably being a fluent speaker since his childhood.\nThe Cantigas are a collection of 420 poems, 356 of which are in a narrative format relating to Marian miracles; the rest of them, except an introduction and two prologues, are of songs of praise or involve Marian festivities. The Cantigas depict the Virgin Mary in a very humanized way, often having her play a role in earthly episodes.\nThe authors are unknown, although several studies have suggested that Galician poet Airas Nunes might have been the author of a large number of the Cantiga poems. King Alfonso X \u2014 named as Affonso in the Cantigas \u2014 is also believed to be an author of some of them as he refers himself in first person. Support for this theory can be found in the prologue of the Cantigas. Also, many sources credit Alfonso owing to his influence on other works within the poetic tradition, including his introduction on religious song. Although King Alfonso X's authorship is debatable, his influence is not. While the other major works that came out of Alfonso's workshops, including histories and other prose texts, were in Castilian, the Cantigas are in Galician-Portuguese, and reflect the popularity in the Castilian court of other poetic corpuses such as the cantigas d'amigo and cantigas d'amor.\nThe metrics are extraordinarily diverse: 280 different formats for the 420 Cantigas. The most common are the \"virelai\" and the \"rondeau\". The length of the lines varies between two and 24 syllables. The narrative voice in many of the songs describes an erotic relationship, in the troubadour fashion, with the Divine.\nThe music is written in notation which is similar to that used for chant, but also contains some information about the length of the notes. Several transcriptions exist. The Cantigas are frequently recorded and performed by early music groups, and quite a few CDs featuring music from the Cantigas are available.\nCodices.\nThe Cantigas are preserved in four manuscripts: \n\"E\" contains the largest number of songs (406 Cantigas, plus the Introduction and the Prologue); it contains 41 carefully detailed miniatures and many illuminated letters. \"To\" is the earliest collection and contains 129 songs. Although not illustrated, it is richly decorated with pen flourished initials, and great care has been taken over its construction. The \"T\" and \"F\" manuscripts are sister volumes. \"T\" contains 195 surviving cantigas (8 are missing due to loss of folios) which roughly correspond in order to the first two hundred in \"E\", each song being illustrated with either 6 or 12 miniatures that depict scenes from the cantiga. \"F\" follows the same format but has only 111 cantigas, of which 7 have no text, only miniatures. These are basically a subset of those found in the second half of \"E\", but are presented here in a radically different order. \"F\" was never finished, and so no music was ever added. Only the empty staves display the intention to add musical notation to the codex at a later date. It is generally thought that the codices were constructed during Alfonso's lifetime, \"To\" perhaps in the 1270s, and \"T\"/\"F\" and \"E\" in the early 1280s up until the time of his death in 1284.\nThe music.\nThe musical forms within the Cantigas, and there are many, are still being studied. There have been many false leads, and there is little beyond pitch value that is very reliable. Mensuration is a particular problem in the Cantigas, and most attempts at determining meaningful rhythmic schemes have tended, with some exceptions, to be unsatisfactory. This remains a lively topic of debate and study. Progress, while on-going, has nevertheless been significant over the course of the last 20 years.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A composer of both secular and sacred music, and a pioneer in the development of opera, he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and Baroque periods of music history.\nBorn in Cremona, where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of Mantua (c.\u20091590\u20131613) and then until his death in the Republic of Venice where he was \"maestro di cappella\" at the basilica of San Marco. His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period, including problems of income, patronage and politics.\nMuch of Monteverdi's output, including many stage works, has been lost. His surviving music includes nine books of madrigals, large-scale religious works, such as his \"Vespro della Beata Vergine\" (\"Vespers for the Blessed Virgin\") of 1610, and three complete operas. His opera \"L'Orfeo\" (1607) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed; towards the end of his life he wrote works for Venice, including \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria\" and \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\".\nWhile he worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance polyphony, as evidenced in his madrigals, he undertook great developments in form and melody, and began to employ the basso continuo technique, distinctive of the Baroque. No stranger to controversy, he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a \"seconda pratica\", contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the \"prima pratica\". Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries, his works enjoyed a rediscovery around the beginning of the twentieth century. He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded.\nLife.\nCremona: 1567\u20131591.\nMonteverdi was baptised in the church of SS Nazaro e Celso, Cremona, on 15 May 1567. The register records his name as \"Claudio Zuan Antonio\" the son of \"Messer Baldasar Mondeverdo\". He was the first child of the apothecary Baldassare Monteverdi and his first wife Maddalena (n\u00e9e Zignani); they had married early the previous year. Claudio's brother Giulio Cesare Monteverdi (b. 1573) was also to become a musician; there were two other brothers and two sisters from Baldassare's marriage to Maddalena and his subsequent marriage in 1576 or 1577. Cremona was close to the border of the Republic of Venice, and not far from the lands controlled by the Duchy of Mantua, in both of which states Monteverdi was later to establish his career.\nThere is no clear record of Monteverdi's early musical training, or evidence that (as is sometimes claimed) he was a member of the Cathedral choir or studied at Cremona University. Monteverdi's first published work, a set of motets, \" (Sacred Songs)\" for three voices, was issued in Venice in 1582, when he was only fifteen years old. In this, and his other initial publications, he describes himself as the pupil of Marc'Antonio Ingegneri, who was from 1581 (and possibly from 1576) to 1592 the \"maestro di cappella\" at Cremona Cathedral. The musicologist Tim Carter deduces that Ingegneri \"gave him a solid grounding in counterpoint and composition\", and that Monteverdi would also have studied playing instruments of the viol family and singing.\nMonteverdi's first publications also give evidence of his connections beyond Cremona, even in his early years. His second published work, \"Madrigali spirituali\" (Spiritual Madrigals, 1583), was printed at Brescia. His next works (his first published secular compositions) were sets of five-part madrigals, according to his biographer Paolo Fabbri: \"the inevitable proving ground for any composer of the second half of the sixteenth century\u00a0... the secular genre \"par excellence\"\". The first book of madrigals (Venice, 1587) was dedicated to Count Marco Verit\u00e0 of Verona; the second book of madrigals (Venice, 1590) was dedicated to the President of the Senate of Milan, Giacomo Ricardi, for whom he had played the viola da braccio in 1587.\nMantua: 1591\u20131613.\nCourt musician.\nIn the dedication of his second book of madrigals, Monteverdi had described himself as a player of the \"vivuola\" (which could mean either viola da gamba or viola da braccio). In 1590 or 1591 he entered the service of Duke Vincenzo I Gonzaga of Mantua; he recalled in his dedication to the Duke of his third book of madrigals (Venice, 1592) that \"the most noble exercise of the \"vivuola\" opened to me the fortunate way into your service.\" In the same dedication he compares his instrumental playing to \"flowers\" and his compositions as \"fruit\" which as it matures \"can more worthily and more perfectly serve you\", indicating his intentions to establish himself as a composer.\nDuke Vincenzo was keen to establish his court as a musical centre, and sought to recruit leading musicians. When Monteverdi arrived in Mantua, the \"maestro di capella\" at the court was the Flemish musician Giaches de Wert. Other notable musicians at the court during this period included the composer and violinist Salomone Rossi, Rossi's sister, the singer Madama Europa, and Francesco Rasi. Monteverdi married the court singer Claudia de Cattaneis in 1599; they were to have three children, two sons (Francesco, b. 1601 and Massimiliano, b. 1604), and a daughter who died soon after birth in 1603. Monteverdi's brother Giulio Cesare joined the court musicians in 1602.\nWhen Wert died in 1596, his post was given to Benedetto Pallavicino, but Monteverdi was clearly highly regarded by Vincenzo and accompanied him on his military campaigns in Hungary (1595) and also on a visit to Flanders in 1599. Here at the town of Spa he is reported by his brother Giulio Cesare as encountering, and bringing back to Italy, the \"canto alla francese\". (The meaning of this, literally \"song in the French style\", is debatable, but may refer to the French-influenced poetry of Gabriello Chiabrera, some of which was set by Monteverdi in his \"Scherzi musicali\", and which departs from the traditional Italian style of lines of 9 or 11 syllables). Monteverdi may possibly have been a member of Vincenzo's entourage at Florence in 1600 for the marriage of Maria de' Medici and Henry IV of France, at which celebrations Jacopo Peri's opera \"Euridice\" (the earliest surviving opera) was premiered. On the death of Pallavicino in 1601, Monteverdi was confirmed as the new \"maestro di capella\".\nArtusi controversy and \"seconda pratica\".\nAt the turn of the 17th century, Monteverdi found himself the target of musical controversy. The influential Bolognese theorist Giovanni Maria Artusi attacked Monteverdi's music (without naming the composer) in his work \"L'Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (Artusi, or On the imperfections of modern music)\" of 1600, followed by a sequel in 1603. Artusi cited extracts from Monteverdi's works not yet published (they later formed parts of his fourth and fifth books of madrigals of 1603 and 1605), condemning their use of harmony and their innovations in use of musical modes, compared to orthodox polyphonic practice of the sixteenth century. Artusi attempted to correspond with Monteverdi on these issues; the composer refused to respond, but found a champion in a pseudonymous supporter, \"L'Ottuso Academico\" (\"The Obtuse Academic\"). Eventually Monteverdi replied in the preface to the fifth book of madrigals that his duties at court prevented him from a detailed reply; but in a note to \"the studious reader\", he claimed that he would shortly publish a response, \"Seconda Pratica, overo Perfettione della Moderna Musica (The Second Style, or Perfection of Modern Music).\" This work never appeared, but a later publication by Claudio's brother Giulio Cesare made it clear that the \"seconda pratica\" which Monteverdi defended was not seen by him as a radical change or his own invention, but was an evolution from previous styles (\"prima pratica\") which was complementary to them.\nThis debate seems in any case to have raised the composer's profile, leading to reprints of his earlier books of madrigals. Some of his madrigals were published in Copenhagen in 1605 and 1606, and the poet Tommaso Stigliani (1573\u20131651) published a eulogy of him in his 1605 poem \"O sirene de' fiumi\". The composer of madrigal comedies and theorist Adriano Banchieri wrote in 1609: \"I must not neglect to mention the most noble of composers, Monteverdi\u00a0... his expressive qualities are truly deserving of the highest commendation, and we find in them countless examples of matchless declamation\u00a0... enhanced by comparable harmonies.\" The modern music historian Massimo Ossi has placed the Artusi issue in the context of Monteverdi's artistic development: \"If the controversy seems to define Monteverdi's historical position, it also seems to have been about stylistic developments that by 1600 Monteverdi had already outgrown\".\nThe non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised explanatory treatise may have been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the \"seconda pratica\" was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit the issue. On the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the \"seconda practica\", in a treatise entitled \"Melodia\"; he may still have been working on this at the time of his death ten years later.\nOpera, conflict and departure.\nIn 1606 Vincenzo's heir Francesco commissioned from Monteverdi the opera \"L'Orfeo\", to a libretto by Alessandro Striggio, for the Carnival season of 1607. It was given two performances in February and March 1607; the singers included, in the title role, Rasi, who had sung in the first performance of \"Euridice\" witnessed by Vincenzo in 1600. This was followed in 1608 by the opera \"L'Arianna\" (libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini), intended for the celebration of the marriage of Francesco to Margherita of Savoy. All the music for this opera is lost apart from \"Ariadne's Lament\", which became extremely popular. To this period also belongs the ballet entertainment \"Il ballo delle ingrate\".\nThe strain of the hard work Monteverdi had been putting into these and other compositions was exacerbated by personal tragedies. His wife died in September 1607 and the young singer Caterina Martinelli, intended for the title role of \"Arianna\", died of smallpox in March 1608. Monteverdi also resented his increasingly poor financial treatment by the Gonzagas. He retired to Cremona in 1608 to convalesce, and wrote a bitter letter to Vincenzo's minister Annibale Chieppio in November of that year seeking (unsuccessfully) \"an honourable dismissal\". Although the Duke increased Monteverdi's salary and pension, and Monteverdi returned to continue his work at the court, he began to seek patronage elsewhere. After publishing his Vespers in 1610, which were dedicated to Pope Paul V, he visited Rome, ostensibly hoping to place his son Francesco at a seminary, but apparently also seeking alternative employment. In the same year he may also have visited Venice, where a large collection of his church music was being printed, with a similar intention.\nDuke Vincenzo died on 18 February 1612. When Francesco succeeded him, court intrigues and cost-cutting led to the dismissal of Monteverdi and his brother Giulio Cesare, who both returned, almost penniless, to Cremona. Despite Francesco's own death from smallpox in December 1612, Monteverdi was unable to return to favour with his successor, his brother Cardinal Ferdinando Gonzaga. In 1613, following the death of Giulio Cesare Martinengo, Monteverdi auditioned for his post as \"maestro\" at the basilica of San Marco in Venice, for which he submitted music for a Mass. He was appointed in August 1613, and given 50 ducats for his expenses (of which he was robbed, together with his other belongings, by highwaymen at Sanguinetto on his return to Cremona).\nVenice: 1613\u20131643.\nMaturity: 1613\u20131630.\nMartinengo had been ill for some time before his death and had left the music of San Marco in a fragile state. The choir had been neglected and the administration overlooked. When Monteverdi arrived to take up his post, his principal responsibility was to recruit, train, discipline and manage the musicians of San Marco (the \"capella\"), who amounted to about 30 singers and six instrumentalists; the numbers could be increased for major events. Among the recruits to the choir was Francesco Cavalli, who joined in 1616 at the age of 14; he was to remain connected with San Marco throughout his life, and was to develop a close association with Monteverdi. Monteverdi also sought to expand the repertory, including not only the traditional \"a cappella\" repertoire of Roman and Flemish composers, but also examples of the modern style which he favoured, including the use of continuo and other instruments. Apart from this he was of course expected to compose music for all the major feasts of the church. This included a new mass each year for Holy Cross Day and Christmas Eve, cantatas in honour of the Venetian Doge, and numerous other works (many of which are lost). Monteverdi was also free to obtain income by providing music for other Venetian churches and for other patrons, and was frequently commissioned to provide music for state banquets. The Procurators of San Marco, to whom Monteverdi was directly responsible, showed their satisfaction with his work in 1616 by raising his annual salary from 300 ducats to 400.\nThe relative freedom which the Republic of Venice afforded him, compared to the problems of court politics in Mantua, are reflected in Monteverdi's letters to Striggio, particularly his letter of 13 March 1620, when he rejects an invitation to return to Mantua, extolling his present position and finances in Venice, and referring to the pension which Mantua still owes him. Nonetheless, remaining a Mantuan citizen, he accepted commissions from the new Duke Ferdinando, who had formally renounced his position as Cardinal in 1616 to take on the duties of state. These included the \"balli\" \"Tirsi e Clori\" (1616) and \"Apollo\" (1620), an opera \"Andromeda\" (1620) and an \"intermedio\", \"Le nozze di Tetide\", for the marriage of Ferdinando with Caterina de' Medici (1617). Most of these compositions were extensively delayed in creation \u2013 partly, as shown by surviving correspondence, through the composer's unwillingness to prioritise them, and partly because of constant changes in the court's requirements. They are now lost, apart from \"Tirsi e Clori\", which was included in the seventh book of madrigals (published 1619) and dedicated to the Duchess Caterina, for which the composer received a pearl necklace from the Duchess. A subsequent major commission, the opera \"La finta pazza Licori\", to a libretto by Giulio Strozzi, was completed for Fernando's successor Vincenzo II, who succeeded to the dukedom in 1626. Because of the latter's illness (he died in 1627), it was never performed, and it is now also lost.\nMonteverdi also received commissions from other Italian states and from their communities in Venice. These included, for the Milanese community in 1620, music for the Feast of St. Charles Borromeo, and for the Florentine community a Requiem Mass for Cosimo II de' Medici (1621). Monteverdi acted on behalf of Paolo Giordano II, Duke of Bracciano, to arrange publication of works by the Cremona musician Francesco Petratti. Among Monteverdi's private Venetian patrons was the nobleman Girolamo Mocenigo, at whose home was premiered in 1624 the dramatic entertainment \"Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda\" based on an episode from Torquato Tasso's \"La Gerusalemme liberata\". In 1627 Monteverdi received a major commission from Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma, for a series of works, and gained leave from the Procurators to spend time there during 1627 and 1628.\nMonteverdi's musical direction received the attention of foreign visitors. The Dutch diplomat and musician Constantijn Huygens, attending a Vespers service at the church of SS. Giovanni e Lucia, wrote that he \"heard the most perfect music I had ever heard in my life. It was directed by the most famous Claudio Monteverdi\u00a0... who was also the composer and was accompanied by four theorbos, two cornettos, two bassoons, one \"basso de viola\" of huge size, organs and other instruments\u00a0...\". Monteverdi wrote a mass, and provided other musical entertainment, for the visit to Venice in 1625 of the Crown Prince W\u0142adys\u0142aw of Poland, who may have sought to revive attempts made a few years previously to lure Monteverdi to Warsaw. He also provided chamber music for Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg, when the latter was paying an incognito visit to Venice in July 1625.\nCorrespondence of Monteverdi in 1625 and 1626 with the Mantuan courtier Ercole Marigliani reveals an interest in alchemy, which apparently Monteverdi had taken up as a hobby. He discusses experiments to transform lead into gold, the problems of obtaining mercury, and mentions commissioning special vessels for his experiments from the glassworks at Murano.\nDespite his generally satisfactory situation in Venice, Monteverdi experienced personal problems from time to time. He was on one occasion \u2013 probably because of his wide network of contacts \u2013 the subject of an anonymous denunciation to the Venetian authorities alleging that he supported the Habsburgs. He was also subject to anxieties about his children. His son Francesco, while a student of law at Padua in 1619, was spending in Monteverdi's opinion too much time with music, and he, therefore, moved him to the University of Bologna. This did not have the required result, and it seems that Monteverdi resigned himself to Francesco having a musical career \u2013 he joined the choir of San Marco in 1623. His other son Massimiliano, who graduated in medicine, was arrested by the Inquisition in Mantua in 1627 for reading forbidden literature. Monteverdi was obliged to sell the necklace he had received from Duchess Caterina to pay for his son's (eventually successful) defence. Monteverdi wrote at the time to Striggio seeking his help, and fearing that Massimiliano might be subject to torture; it seems that Striggio's intervention was helpful. Money worries at this time also led Monteverdi to visit Cremona to secure for himself a church canonry.\nPause and priesthood: 1630\u20131637.\nA series of disturbing events troubled Monteverdi's world in the period around 1630. Mantua was invaded by Habsburg armies in 1630, who besieged the plague-stricken town, and after its fall in July looted its treasures, and dispersed the artistic community. The plague was carried to Mantua's ally Venice by an embassy led by Monteverdi's confidante Striggio, and over a period of 16 months led to over 45,000 deaths, leaving Venice's population in 1633 at just above 100,000, the lowest level for about 150 years. Among the plague victims was Monteverdi's assistant at San Marco, and a notable composer in his own right, Alessandro Grandi. The plague and the after-effects of war had an inevitable deleterious effect on the economy and artistic life of Venice. Monteverdi's younger brother Giulio Cesare also died at this time, probably from the plague.\nBy this time Monteverdi was in his sixties, and his rate of composition seems to have slowed down. He had written a setting of Strozzi's \"Proserpina rapita (The Abduction of Proserpina)\", now lost except for one vocal trio, for a Mocenigo wedding in 1630, and produced a Mass for deliverance from the plague for San Marco which was performed in November 1631. His set of \"Scherzi musicali\" was published in Venice in 1632. In 1631, Monteverdi was admitted to the tonsure, and was ordained deacon, and later priest, in 1632. Although these ceremonies took place in Venice, he was nominated as a member of Diocese of Cremona; this may imply that he intended to retire there.\nLate flowering: 1637\u20131643.\nThe opening of the opera house of San Cassiano in 1637, the first public opera house in Europe, stimulated the city's musical life and coincided with a new burst of the composer's activity. The year 1638 saw the publication of Monteverdi's eighth book of madrigals and a revision of the \"Ballo delle ingrate\". The eighth book contains a \"ballo\", \"Volgendi il ciel\", which may have been composed for the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand III, to whom the book is dedicated. The years 1640\u20131641 saw the publication of the extensive collection of church music, \"Selva morale e spirituale\". Among other commissions, Monteverdi wrote music in 1637 and 1638 for Strozzi's \"Accademia degli Unisoni\" in Venice, and in 1641 a ballet, \"La vittoria d'Amore\", for the court of Piacenza.\nMonteverdi was still not entirely free from his responsibilities for the musicians at San Marco. He wrote to complain about one of his singers to the Procurators, on 9 June 1637: \"I, Claudio Monteverdi\u00a0... come humbly\u00a0... to set forth to you how Domenicato Aldegati\u00a0... a bass, yesterday morning\u00a0... at the time of the greatest concourse of people\u00a0... spoke these exact words\u00a0...'The Director of Music comes from a brood of cut-throat bastards, a thieving, fucking, he-goat\u00a0... and I shit on him and whoever protects him\u00a0...'\".\nMonteverdi's contribution to opera at this period is notable. He revised his earlier opera \"L'Arianna\" in 1640 and wrote three new works for the commercial stage, \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (The Return of Ulysses to his Homeland\", 1640, first performed in Bologna with Venetian singers), \"Le nozze d'Enea e Lavinia (The Marriage of Aeneas and Lavinia\", 1641, music now lost), and \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\" (\"The Coronation of Poppea\", 1643). The introduction to the printed scenario of \"Le nozze d'Enea\", by an unknown author, acknowledges that Monteverdi is to be credited for the rebirth of theatrical music and that \"he will be sighed for in later ages, for his compositions will surely outlive the ravages of time.\"\nIn his last surviving letter (20 August 1643), Monteverdi, already ill, was still hoping for the settlement of the long-disputed pension from Mantua, and asked the Doge of Venice to intervene on his behalf. He died in Venice on 29 November 1643, after paying a brief visit to Cremona, and is buried in the Church of the Frari. He was survived by his sons; Masimilliano died in 1661, Francesco after 1677.\nMusic.\nBackground: Renaissance to Baroque.\nThere is a consensus among music historians that a period extending from the mid-15th century to around 1625, characterised in Lewis Lockwood's phrase by \"substantial unity of outlook and language\", should be identified as the period of \"Renaissance music\". Musical literature has also defined the succeeding period (covering music from approximately 1580 to 1750) as the era of \"Baroque music\". It is in the late-16th to early-17th-century overlap of these periods that much of Monteverdi's creativity flourished; he stands as a transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque.\nIn the Renaissance era, music had developed as a formal discipline, a \"pure science of relationships\" in the words of Lockwood. In the Baroque era it became a form of aesthetic expression, increasingly used to adorn religious, social and festive celebrations in which, in accordance with Plato's ideal, the music was subordinated to the text. Solo singing with instrumental accompaniment, or monody, acquired greater significance towards the end of the 16th century, replacing polyphony as the principal means of dramatic music expression. This was the changing world in which Monteverdi was active. Percy Scholes in his \"Oxford Companion to Music\" describes the \"new music\" thus: \"[Composers] discarded the choral polyphony of the madrigal style as barbaric, and set dialogue or soliloquy for single voices, imitating more or less the inflexions of speech and accompanying the voice by playing mere supporting chords. Short choruses were interspersed, but they too were homophonic rather than polyphonic.\"\nNovice years: Madrigal books 1 and 2.\nIngegneri, Monteverdi's first tutor, was a master of the \"musica reservata\" vocal style, which involved the use of chromatic progressions and word-painting; Monteverdi's early compositions were grounded in this style. Ingegneri was a traditional Renaissance composer, \"something of an anachronism\", according to Arnold, but Monteverdi also studied the work of more \"modern\" composers such as Luca Marenzio, Luzzasco Luzzaschi, and a little later, Giaches de Wert, from whom he would learn the art of expressing passion. He was a precocious and productive student, as indicated by his youthful publications of 1582\u201383. Mark Ringer writes that \"these teenaged efforts reveal palpable ambition matched with a convincing mastery of contemporary style\", but at this stage they display their creator's competence rather than any striking originality. Geoffrey Chew classifies them as \"not in the most modern vein for the period\", acceptable but out-of-date. Chew rates the \"Canzonette\" collection of 1584 much more highly than the earlier juvenilia: \"These brief three-voice pieces draw on the airy, modern style of the villanellas of Marenzio, [drawing on] a substantial vocabulary of text-related madrigalisms\".\nThe canzonetta form was much used by composers of the day as a technical exercise, and is a prominent element in Monteverdi's first book of madrigals published in 1587. In this book, the playful, pastoral settings again reflect the style of Marenzio, while Luzzaschi's influence is evident in Monteverdi's use of dissonance. The second book (1590) begins with a setting modelled on Marenzio of a modern verse, Torquato Tasso's \"Non si levav' ancor\", and concludes with a text from 50 years earlier: Pietro Bembo's \"Cantai un tempo\". Monteverdi set the latter to music in an archaic style reminiscent of the long-dead Cipriano de Rore. Between them is \"Ecco mormorar l'onde\", strongly influenced by de Wert and hailed by Chew as the great masterpiece of the second book.\nA thread common throughout these early works is Monteverdi's use of the technique of \"imitatio\", a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.\nMadrigals 1590\u20131605: books 3, 4, 5.\nMonteverdi's first fifteen years of service in Mantua are bracketed by his publications of the third book of madrigals in 1592 and the fourth and fifth books in 1603 and 1605. Between 1592 and 1603 he made minor contributions to other anthologies. How much he composed in this period is a matter of conjecture; his many duties in the Mantuan court may have limited his opportunities, but several of the madrigals that he published in the fourth and fifth books were written and performed during the 1590s, some figuring prominently in the Artusi controversy.\nThe third book shows strongly the increased influence of Wert, by that time Monteverdi's direct superior as \"maestro de capella\" at Mantua. Two poets dominate the collection: Tasso, whose lyrical poetry had figured prominently in the second book but is here represented through the more epic, heroic verses from \"Gerusalemme liberata\", and Giovanni Battista Guarini, whose verses had appeared sporadically in Monteverdi's earlier publications, but form around half of the contents of the third book. Wert's influence is reflected in Monteverdi's forthrightly modern approach, and his expressive and chromatic settings of Tasso's verses. Of the Guarini settings, Chew writes: \"The epigrammatic style\u00a0... closely matches a poetic and musical ideal of the period\u00a0... [and] often depends on strong, final cadential progressions, with or without the intensification provided by chains of suspended dissonances\". Chew cites the setting of \"Stracciami pur il core\" as \"a prime example of Monteverdi's irregular dissonance practice\". Tasso and Guarini were both regular visitors to the Mantuan court; Monteverdi's association with them and his absorption of their ideas may have helped lay the foundations of his own approach to the musical dramas that he would create a decade later.\nAs the 1590s progressed, Monteverdi moved closer towards the form that he would identify in due course as the \"seconda pratica\". Claude V. Palisca quotes the madrigal \"Ohim\u00e8, se tanto amate\", published in the fourth book but written before 1600 \u2013 it is among the works attacked by Artusi \u2013 as a typical example of the composer's developing powers of invention. In this madrigal Monteverdi again departs from the established practice in the use of dissonance, by means of a vocal ornament Palisca describes as \"\u00e9chapp\u00e9\". Monteverdi's daring use of this device is, says Palisca, \"like a forbidden pleasure\". In this and in other settings the poet's images were supreme, even at the expense of musical consistency.\nThe fourth book includes madrigals to which Artusi objected on the grounds of their \"modernism\". However, Ossi describes it as \"an anthology of disparate works firmly rooted in the 16th century\", closer in nature to the third book than to the fifth. Besides Tasso and Guarini, Monteverdi set to music verses by Rinuccini, Maurizio Moro (\"S\u00ec ch'io vorrei morire\") and Ridolfo Arlotti (\"Luci serene e chiare\"). There is evidence of the composer's familiarity with the works of Carlo Gesualdo, and with composers of the school of Ferrara such as Luzzaschi; the book was dedicated to a Ferrarese musical society, the \"Accademici Intrepidi\".\nThe fifth book looks more to the future; for example, Monteverdi employs the \"concertato\" style with basso continuo (a device that was to become a typical feature in the emergent Baroque era), and includes a \"sinfonia\" (instrumental interlude) in the final piece. He presents his music through complex counterpoint and daring harmonies, although at times combining the expressive possibilities of the new music with traditional polyphony.\nAquilino Coppini drew much of the music for his sacred contrafacta of 1608 from Monteverdi's 3rd, 4th and 5th books of madrigals. In writing to a friend in 1609 Coppini commented that Monteverdi's pieces \"require, during their performance, more flexible rests and bars that are not strictly regular, now pressing forward or abandoning themselves to slowing down [...] In them there is a truly wondrous capacity for moving the affections\".\nOpera and sacred music: 1607\u20131612.\nIn Monteverdi's final five years' service in Mantua he completed the operas \"L'Orfeo\" (1607) and \"L'Arianna\" (1608), and wrote quantities of sacred music, including the \"Messa in illo tempore\" (1610) and also the collection known as \"Vespro della Beata Vergine\" which is often referred to as \"Monteverdi's \"Vespers\"\" (1610). He also published \"Scherzi musicale a tre voci\" (1607), settings of verses composed since 1599 and dedicated to the Gonzaga heir, Francesco. The vocal trio in the \"Scherzi\" comprises two sopranos and a bass, accompanied by simple instrumental ritornellos. According to Bowers the music \"reflected the modesty of the prince's resources; it was, nevertheless, the earliest publication to associate voices and instruments in this particular way\".\n\"L'Orfeo\".\nThe opera opens with a brief trumpet toccata. The prologue of La musica (a figure representing music) is introduced with a ritornello by the strings, repeated often to represent the \"power of music\" \u2013 one of the earliest examples of an operatic leitmotif. Act 1 presents a pastoral idyll, the buoyant mood of which continues into Act 2. The confusion and grief which follow the news of Euridice's death are musically reflected by harsh dissonances and the juxtaposition of keys. The music remains in this vein until the act ends with the consoling sounds of the ritornello.\nAct 3 is dominated by Orfeo's aria \"Possente spirto e formidabil nume\" by which he attempts to persuade Caronte to allow him to enter Hades. Monteverdi's vocal embellishments and virtuoso accompaniment provide what Tim Carter has described as \"one of the most compelling visual and aural representations\" in early opera. In Act 4 the warmth of Proserpina's singing on behalf of Orfeo is retained until Orfeo fatally \"looks back\". The brief final act, which sees Orfeo's rescue and metamorphosis, is framed by the final appearance of the ritornello and by a lively moresca that brings the audience back to their everyday world.\nThroughout the opera Monteverdi makes innovative use of polyphony, extending the rules beyond the conventions which composers normally observed in fidelity to Palestrina. He combines elements of the traditional 16th-century madrigal with the new monodic style where the text dominates the music and sinfonias and instrumental ritornellos illustrate the action.\n\"L'Arianna\".\nThe music for this opera is lost except for the \"Lamento d'Arianna\", which was published in the sixth book in 1614 as a five-voice madrigal; a separate monodic version was published in 1623. In its operatic context the lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Throughout, indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until a descending line brings the piece to a quiet conclusion.\nThe musicologist Suzanne Cusick writes that Monteverdi \"creat[ed] the lament as a recognizable genre of vocal chamber music and as a standard scene in opera\u00a0... that would become crucial, almost genre-defining, to the full-scale public operas of 17th-century Venice\". Cusick observes how Monteverdi is able to match in music the \"rhetorical and syntactical gestures\" in the text of Ottavio Rinuccini. The opening repeated words \"Lasciatemi morire\" (Let me die) are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which Ringer describes as \"an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain\". Ringer suggests that the lament defines Monteverdi's innovative creativity in a manner similar to that in which the Prelude and the Liebestod in \"Tristan und Isolde\" announced Wagner's discovery of new expressive frontiers.\nRinuccini's full libretto, which has survived, was set in modern times by Alexander Goehr (\"Arianna\", 1995), including a version of Monteverdi's \"Lament\".\nVespers.\nThe \"Vespro della Beata Vergine\", Monteverdi's first published sacred music since the \"Madrigali spirituali\" of 1583, consists of 14 components: an introductory versicle and response, five psalms interspersed with five \"sacred concertos\" (Monteverdi's term), a hymn, and two Magnificat settings. Collectively these pieces fulfil the requirements for a Vespers service on any feast day of the Virgin. Monteverdi employs many musical styles; the more traditional features, such as cantus firmus, falsobordone and Venetian canzone, are mixed with the latest madrigal style, including echo effects and chains of dissonances. Some of the musical features used are reminiscent of \"L'Orfeo\", written slightly earlier for similar instrumental and vocal forces.\nIn this work the \"sacred concertos\" fulfil the role of the antiphons which divide the psalms in regular Vespers services. Their non-liturgical character has led writers to question whether they should be within the service, or indeed whether this was Monteverdi's intention. In some versions of Monteverdi's \"Vespers\" (for example, those of Denis Stevens) the concertos are replaced with antiphons associated with the Virgin, although John Whenham in his analysis of the work argues that the collection as a whole should be regarded as a single liturgical and artistic entity.\nAll the psalms, and the Magnificat, are based on melodically limited and repetitious Gregorian chant psalm tones, around which Monteverdi builds a range of innovative textures. This concertato style challenges the traditional cantus firmus, and is most evident in the \"Sonata sopra Sancta Maria\", written for eight string and wind instruments plus basso continuo, and a single soprano voice. Monteverdi uses modern rhythms, frequent metre changes and constantly varying textures; yet, according to John Eliot Gardiner, \"for all the virtuosity of its instrumental writing and the evident care which has gone into the combinations of timbre\", Monteverdi's chief concern was resolving the proper combination of words and music.\nThe actual musical ingredients of the Vespers were not novel to Mantua \u2013 concertato had been used by Lodovico Grossi da Viadana, a former choirmaster at the cathedral of Mantua, while the \"Sonata sopra\" had been anticipated by Archangelo Crotti in his \"Sancta Maria\" published in 1608. It is, writes Denis Arnold, Monteverdi's mixture of the various elements that makes the music unique. Arnold adds that the Vespers achieved fame and popularity only after their 20th-century rediscovery; they were not particularly regarded in Monteverdi's time.\nMadrigals 1614\u20131638: books 6, 7 and 8.\nSixth book.\nDuring his years in Venice Monteverdi published his sixth (1614), seventh (1619) and eighth (1638) books of madrigals. The sixth book consists of works written before the composer's departure from Mantua. Hans Redlich sees it as a transitional work, containing Monteverdi's last madrigal compositions in the manner of the \"prima pratica\", together with music which is typical of the new style of expression which Monteverdi had displayed in the dramatic works of 1607\u201308. The central theme of the collection is loss; the best-known work is the five-voice version of the \"Lamento d'Arianna\", which, says Massimo Ossi, gives \"an object lesson in the close relationship between monodic recitative and counterpoint\". The book contains Monteverdi's first settings of verses by Giambattista Marino, and two settings of Petrarch which Ossi considers the most extraordinary pieces in the volume, providing some \"stunning musical moments\".\nSeventh book.\nWhile Monteverdi had looked backwards in the sixth book, he moved forward in the seventh book from the traditional concept of the madrigal, and from monody, in favour of chamber duets. There are exceptions, such the two solo \"lettere amorose\" (love letters) \"Se i languidi miei sguardi\" and \"Se pur destina e vole\", written to be performed \"genere rapresentativo\" \u2013 acted as well as sung. Of the duets which are the main features of the volume, Chew highlights \"Ohim\u00e9, dov'\u00e8 il mio ben, dov'\u00e8 il mio core\", a romanesca in which two high voices express dissonances above a repetitive bass pattern. The book also contains large-scale ensemble works, and the ballet \"Tirsi e Clori\". This was the height of Monteverdi's \"Marino period\"; six of the pieces in the book are settings of the poet's verses. As Carter puts it, Monteverdi \"embraced Marino's madrigalian kisses and love-bites with\u00a0... the enthusiasm typical of the period\". Some commentators have opined that the composer should have had better poetic taste.\nEighth book.\nThe eighth book, subtitled \"Madrigali guerrieri, et amorosi\u00a0...\" (\"Madrigals of war and love\") is structured in two symmetrical halves, one for \"war\" and one for \"love\". Each half begins with a six-voice setting, followed by an equally large-scale Petrarch setting, then a series of duets mainly for tenor voices, and concludes with a theatrical number and a final ballet. The \"war\" half contains several items written as tributes to the emperor Ferdinand III, who had succeeded to the Habsburg throne in 1637. Many of Monteverdi's familiar poets \u2013 Strozzi, Rinuccini, Tasso, Marino, Guarini \u2013 are represented in the settings.\nIt is difficult to gauge when many of the pieces were composed, although the ballet \"Mascherata dell' ingrate\" that ends the book dates back to 1608 and the celebration of the Gonzaga-Savoy marriage. The \"Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda\", centrepiece of the \"war\" settings, had been written and performed in Venice in 1624; on its publication in the eighth book, Monteverdi explicitly linked it to his concept of \"concitato genera\" (otherwise \"stile concitato\" \u2013 \"aroused style\") that would \"fittingly imitate the utterance and the accents of a brave man who is engaged in warfare\", and implied that since he had originated this style, others had begun to copy it. The work employed for the first time instructions for the use of pizzicato string chords, and also evocations of fanfares and other sounds of combat.\nThe critic Andrew Clements describes the eighth book as \"a statement of artistic principles and compositional authority\", in which Monteverdi \"shaped and expanded the madrigal form to accommodate what he wanted to do\u00a0... the pieces collected in Book Eight make up a treasury of what music in the first half the 17th century could possibly express.\"\nOther Venetian music: 1614\u20131638.\nDuring this period of his Venetian residency, Monteverdi composed quantities of sacred music. Numerous motets and other short works were included in anthologies by local publishers such as Giulio Cesare Bianchi (a former student of Monteverdi) and Lorenzo Calvi, and others were published elsewhere in Italy and Austria. The range of styles in the motets is broad, from simple strophic arias with string accompaniment to full-scale declamations with an alleluia finale.\nMonteverdi retained emotional and political attachments to the Mantuan court and wrote for it, or undertook to write, large amounts of stage music including at least four operas. The ballet \"Tirsi e Clori\" survives through its inclusion in the seventh book, but the rest of the Mantuan dramatic music is lost. Many of the missing manuscripts may have disappeared in the wars that overcame Mantua in 1630. The most significant aspect of their loss, according to Carter, is the extent to which they might have provided musical links between Monteverdi's early Mantuan operas and those he wrote in Venice after 1638: \"Without these links\u00a0... it is hard to a produce a coherent account of his development as a composer for the stage\". Likewise, Janet Beat regrets that the 30-year gap hampers the study of how opera orchestration developed during those critical early years.\nApart from the madrigal books, Monteverdi's only published collection during this period was the volume of \"Scherzi musicale\" in 1632. For unknown reasons, the composer's name does not appear on the inscription, the dedication being signed by the Venetian printer Bartolomeo Magni; Carter surmises that the recently ordained Monteverdi may have wished to keep his distance from this secular collection. It mixes strophic continuo songs for solo voice with more complex works which employ continuous variation over repeated bass patterns. Chew selects the chaconne for two tenors, \"Zefiro torna e di soavi accenti\", as the outstanding item in the collection: \"[T]he greater part of this piece consists of repetitions of a bass pattern which ensures tonal unity of a simple kind, owing to its being framed as a simple cadence in a G major tonal type: over these repetitions, inventive variations unfold in virtuoso passage-work\".\nLate operas and final works.\n\"Main articles\": \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria\"; \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\"; \"Selva morale e spirituale\"\nThe last years of Monteverdi's life were much occupied with opera for the Venetian stage. Richard Taruskin, in his \"Oxford History of Western Music\", gave his chapter on this topic the title \"Opera from Monteverdi to Monteverdi.\" This wording, originally proposed humorously by the Italian music historian Nino Pirrotta, is interpreted seriously by Taruskin as indicating that Monteverdi is significantly responsible for the transformation of the opera genre from a private entertainment of the nobility (as with \"Orfeo\" in 1607), to what became a major commercial genre, as exemplified by his opera \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\" (1643). His two surviving operatic works of this period, \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria\" and \"L'incoronazione\" are held by Arnold to be the first \"modern\" operas; \"Il ritorno\" is the first Venetian opera to depart from what Ellen Rosand terms \"the mythological pastoral\". However, David Johnson in the \"North American Review\" warns audiences not to expect immediate affinity with Mozart, Verdi or Puccini: \"You have to submit yourself to a much slower pace, to a much more chaste conception of melody, to a vocal style that is at first merely like dry declamation and only on repeated hearings begins to assume an extraordinary eloquence.\"\n\"Il ritorno\", says Carter, is clearly influenced by Monteverdi's earlier works. Penelope's lament in Act I is close in character to the lament from \"L'Arianna\", while the martial episodes recall \"Il combattimento\". \"Stile concitato\" is prominent in the fight scenes and in the slaying of Penelope's suitors. In \"L'incoronazione\", Monteverdi represents moods and situations by specific musical devices: triple metre stands for the language of love; arpeggios demonstrate conflict; \"stile concitato\" represents rage. There is continuing debate about how much of the extant \"L'incoronazione\" music is Monteverdi's original, and how much is the work of others (there are, for instance, traces of music by Francesco Cavalli).\nThe \"Selva morale e spirituale\" of 1641, and the posthumous \"Messa et salmi\" published in 1650 (which was edited by Cavalli), are selections of the sacred music that Monteverdi wrote for San Marco during his 30-year tenure \u2013 much else was likely written but not published. The \"Selva morale\" volume opens with a series of madrigal settings on moral texts, dwelling on themes such as \"the transitory nature of love, earthly rank and achievement, even existence itself\". They are followed by a Mass in conservative style (\"stile antico\"), the high point of which is an extended seven-voice \"Gloria\". Scholars believe that this might have been written to celebrate the end of the 1631 plague. The rest of the volume is made up of numerous psalm settings, two Magnificats and three \"Salve Reginas\". The \"Messa et salmi\" volume includes a \"stile antico\" Mass for four voices, a polyphonic setting of the psalm \"Laetatus Sum\", and a version of the Litany of Lareto that Monteverdi had originally published in 1620.\nThe posthumous ninth book of madrigals was published in 1651, a miscellany dating back to the early 1630s, some items being repeats of previously published pieces, such as the popular duet \"O sia tranquillo il mare\" from 1638. The book includes a trio for three sopranos, \"Come dolce oggi l'auretta\", which is the only surviving music from the 1630 lost opera \"Proserpina rapita\".\nHistorical perspective.\nIn his lifetime Monteverdi enjoyed considerable status among musicians and the public. This is evidenced by the scale of his funeral rites: \"[W]ith truly royal pomp a catafalque was erected in the Chiesa de Padrini Minori de Frari, decorated all in mourning, but surrounded with so many candles that the church resembled a night sky luminous with stars\". This glorification was transitory; Carter writes that in Monteverdi's day, music rarely survived beyond the circumstances of its initial performance and was quickly forgotten along with its creator. In this regard Monteverdi fared better than most. His operatic works were revived in several cities in the decade following his death; according to Severo Bonini, writing in 1651, every musical household in Italy possessed a copy of the \"Lamento d'Arianna\".\nThe German composer Heinrich Sch\u00fctz, who had studied in Venice under Giovanni Gabrieli shortly before Monteverdi's arrival there, possessed a copy of \"Il combattimento\" and himself took up elements of the \"stile concitato\". On his second visit to Venice in 1628\u20131629, Arnold believes, Sch\u00fctz absorbed the concepts of \"basso continuo\" and expressiveness of word-setting, but he opines that Sch\u00fctz was more directly influenced by the style of the younger generation of Venetian composers, including Grandi and Giovanni Rovetta (the eventual successor to Monteverdi at San Marco). Sch\u00fctz published a first book of \"Symphoniae sacrae\", settings of biblical texts in the style of \"seconda pratica\", in Venice in 1629. \"Es steh Gott auf\", from his \"Symphoniae sacrae II\", published in Dresden in 1647, contains specific quotations from Monteverdi.\nAfter the 1650s, Monteverdi's name quickly disappears from contemporary accounts, his music generally forgotten except for the \"Lamento\", the prototype of a genre that would endure well into the 18th century.\nInterest in Monteverdi revived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries among music scholars in Germany and Italy, although he was still regarded as essentially a historical curiosity. Wider interest in the music itself began in 1881, when Robert Eitner published a shortened version of the \"Orfeo\" score. Around this time Kurt Vogel scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but more critical interest was shown in the operas, following the discovery of the \"L'incoronazione\" manuscript in 1888 and that of \"Il ritorno\" in 1904. Largely through the efforts of Vincent d'Indy, all three operas were staged in one form or another, during the first quarter of the 20th century: \"L'Orfeo\" in May 1911, \"L'incoronazione\" in February 1913 and \"Il ritorno\" in May 1925.\nThe Italian nationalist poet Gabriele D'Annunzio lauded Monteverdi and in his novel \"Il fuoco\" (1900) wrote of \"\"il divino Claudio\"\u00a0... what a heroic soul, purely Italian in its essence!\" His vision of Monteverdi as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism was adopted by musicians who worked with the regime of Benito Mussolini (1922\u20131945), including Gian Francesco Malipiero, Luigi Dallapiccola, and Mario Labroca, who contrasted Monteverdi with the decadence of the music of Richard Strauss, Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky.\nIn the years after the Second World War the operas began to be performed in the major opera houses, and eventually were established in the general repertory. The resuscitation of Monteverdi's sacred music took longer; he did not benefit from the Catholic Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music in the way that Palestrina did, perhaps, as Carter suggests, because Monteverdi was viewed chiefly as a secular composer. It was not until 1932 that the 1610 \"Vespers\" were published in a modern edition, followed by Redlich's revision two years later. Modern editions of the \"Selva morale\" and \"Missa e Salmi\" volumes were published respectively in 1940 and 1942.\nThe revival of public interest in Monteverdi's music gathered pace in the second half of the 20th century, reaching full spate in the general early-music revival of the 1970s, during which time the emphasis turned increasingly towards \"authentic\" performance using historical instruments. The magazine \"Gramophone\" notes over 30 recordings of the \"Vespers\" between 1976 and 2011, and 27 of \"Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda\" between 1971 and 2013. Monteverdi's surviving operas are today regularly performed; the website Operabase notes 555 performances of the operas in 149 productions worldwide in the seasons 2011\u20132016, ranking Monteverdi at 30th position for all composers, and at 8th ranking for Italian opera composers. In 1985, Manfred H. Stattkus published an index to Monteverdi's works, the Stattkus-Verzeichnis, (revised in 2006) giving each composition an \"SV\" number, to be used for cataloguing and references.\nMonteverdi is lauded by modern critics as \"the most significant composer in late Renaissance and early Baroque Italy\"; \"one of the principal composers in the history of Western music\"; and, routinely, as the first great opera composer. These assessments reflect a contemporary perspective, since his music was largely unknown to the composers who followed him during an extensive period, spanning more than two centuries after his death. It is, as Redlich and others have pointed out, the composers of the 20th and 21st century who have rediscovered Monteverdi and sought to make his music a basis for their own. Possibly, as Chew suggests, they are attracted by Monteverdi's reputation as \"a Modern, a breaker of rules, against the Ancients, those who deferred to ancient authority\" \u2013 although the composer was, essentially, a pragmatist, \"showing what can only be described as an opportunistic and eclectic willingness to use whatever lay to hand for the purpose\". In a letter dated 16 October 1633, Monteverdi appears to endorse the view of himself as a \"modern\": \"I would rather be moderately praised for the new style than greatly praised for the ordinary\". However, Chew, in his final summation, sees the composer historically as facing both ways, willing to use modern techniques but while at the same time protective of his status as a competent composer in the \"stile antico\". Thus, says Chew, \"his achievement was both retrospective and progressive\". Monteverdi represents the late Renaissance era while simultaneously summing up much of the early Baroque. \"And in one respect in particular, his achievement was enduring: the effective projection of human emotions in music, in a way adequate for theatre as well as for chamber music.\"\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "6229", "revid": "44389617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6229", "title": "Colossus computer", "text": "Early British cryptanalysis computer\nColossus was a set of computers developed by British codebreakers in the years 1943\u20131945 to help in the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher. Colossus used thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) to perform Boolean and counting operations. Colossus is thus regarded as the world's first programmable, electronic, digital computer, although it was programmed by switches and plugs and not by a stored program.\nColossus was designed by General Post Office (GPO) research telephone engineer Tommy Flowers to solve a problem posed by mathematician Max Newman at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park. Alan Turing's use of probability in cryptanalysis (see Banburismus) contributed to its design. It has sometimes been erroneously stated that Turing designed Colossus to aid the cryptanalysis of the Enigma. (Turing's machine that helped decode Enigma was the electromechanical Bombe, not Colossus.)\nThe prototype, Colossus Mark 1, was shown to be working in December 1943 and was in use at Bletchley Park by early 1944. An improved Colossus Mark 2 that used shift registers to quintuple the processing speed, first worked on 1 June 1944, just in time for the Normandy landings on D-Day. Ten Colossi were in use by the end of the war and an eleventh was being commissioned. Bletchley Park's use of these machines allowed the Allies to obtain a vast amount of high-level military intelligence from intercepted radiotelegraphy messages between the German High Command (\"OKW\") and their army commands throughout occupied Europe.\nThe existence of the Colossus machines was kept secret until the mid-1970s. All but two machines were dismantled into such small parts that their use could not be inferred. The two retained machines were eventually dismantled in the 1960s. A functioning rebuild of a Mark 2 Colossus was completed in 2008 by Tony Sale and a team of volunteers; it is on display at The National Museum of Computing on Bletchley Park.\nPurpose and origins.\nThe Colossus computers were used to help decipher intercepted radio teleprinter messages that had been encrypted using an unknown device. Intelligence information revealed that the Germans called the wireless teleprinter transmission systems \"S\u00e4gefisch\" (sawfish). This led the British to call encrypted German teleprinter traffic \"Fish\", and the unknown machine and its intercepted messages \"Tunny\" (tunafish).\nBefore the Germans increased the security of their operating procedures, British cryptanalysts diagnosed how the unseen machine functioned and built an imitation of it called \"British Tunny\".\nIt was deduced that the machine had twelve wheels and used a Vernam ciphering technique on message characters in the standard 5-bit ITA2 telegraph code. It did this by combining the plaintext characters with a stream of key characters using the XOR Boolean function to produce the ciphertext.\nIn August 1941, a blunder by German operators led to the transmission of two versions of the same message with identical machine settings. These were intercepted and worked on at Bletchley Park. First, John Tiltman, a very talented GC&amp;CS cryptanalyst, derived a key stream of almost 4000 characters. Then Bill Tutte, a newly arrived member of the Research Section, used this keystream to work out the logical structure of the Lorenz machine. He deduced that the twelve wheels consisted of two groups of five, which he named the \u03c7 (\"chi\") and \u03c8 (\"psi\") wheels, the remaining two he called \u03bc (\"mu\") or \"motor\" wheels. The \"chi\" wheels stepped regularly with each letter that was encrypted, while the \"psi\" wheels stepped irregularly, under the control of the motor wheels.\nWith a sufficiently random keystream, a Vernam cipher removes the natural language property of a plaintext message of having an uneven frequency distribution of the different characters, to produce a uniform distribution in the ciphertext. The Tunny machine did this well. However, the cryptanalysts worked out that by examining the frequency distribution of the character-to-character changes in the ciphertext, instead of the plain characters, there was a departure from uniformity which provided a way into the system. This was achieved by \"differencing\" in which each bit or character was XOR-ed with its successor. After Germany surrendered, allied forces captured a Tunny machine and discovered that it was the electromechanical Lorenz SZ (\"Schl\u00fcsselzusatzger\u00e4t\", cipher attachment) in-line cipher machine.\nIn order to decrypt the transmitted messages, two tasks had to be performed. The first was \"wheel breaking\", which was the discovery of the cam patterns for all the wheels. These patterns were set up on the Lorenz machine and then used for a fixed period of time for a succession of different messages. Each transmission, which often contained more than one message, was enciphered with a different start position of the wheels. Alan Turing invented a method of wheel-breaking that became known as Turingery. Turing's technique was further developed into \"Rectangling\", for which Colossus could produce tables for manual analysis. Colossi 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 had a \"gadget\" to aid this process.\nThe second task was \"wheel setting\", which worked out the start positions of the wheels for a particular message and could only be attempted once the cam patterns were known. It was this task for which Colossus was initially designed. To discover the start position of the \"chi\" wheels for a message, Colossus compared two character streams, counting statistics from the evaluation of programmable Boolean functions. The two streams were the ciphertext, which was read at high speed from a paper tape, and the keystream, which was generated internally, in a simulation of the unknown German machine. After a succession of different Colossus runs to discover the likely \"chi\"-wheel settings, they were checked by examining the frequency distribution of the characters in the processed ciphertext. Colossus produced these frequency counts.\nDecryption processes.\nBy using differencing and knowing that the \"psi\" wheels did not advance with each character, Tutte worked out that trying just two differenced bits (impulses) of the \"chi\"-stream against the differenced ciphertext would produce a statistic that was non-random. This became known as Tutte's \"1+2 break in\". It involved calculating the following Boolean function:\nformula_1\nand counting the number of times it yielded \"false\" (zero). If this number exceeded a pre-defined threshold value known as the \"set total\", it was printed out. The cryptanalyst would examine the printout to determine which of the putative start positions was most likely to be the correct one for the \"chi\"-1 and \"chi\"-2 wheels.\nThis technique would then be applied to other pairs of, or single, impulses to determine the likely start position of all five \"chi\" wheels. From this, the de-\"chi\" (D) of a ciphertext could be obtained, from which the \"psi\" component could be removed by manual methods. If the frequency distribution of characters in the de-\"chi\" version of the ciphertext was within certain bounds, \"wheel setting\" of the \"chi\" wheels was considered to have been achieved, and the message settings and de-\"chi\" were passed to the \"Testery\". This was the section at Bletchley Park led by Major Ralph Tester where the bulk of the decrypting work was done by manual and linguistic methods.\nColossus could also derive the start position of the \"psi\" and motor wheels, but this was not much done until the last few months of the war when there were plenty of Colossi available and the number of Tunny messages had declined.\nDesign and construction.\nColossus was developed for the \"Newmanry\", the section headed by the mathematician Max Newman that was responsible for machine methods against the twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ40/42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine (code-named Tunny, for tunafish). The Colossus design arose out of a prior project that produced a counting machine dubbed \"Heath Robinson\". Although it proved the concept of machine analysis for this part of the process, it was initially unreliable. The electro-mechanical parts were relatively slow and it was difficult to synchronise two looped paper tapes, one containing the enciphered message, and the other representing part of the keystream of the Lorenz machine, also the tapes tended to stretch when being read at up to 2000 characters per second.\nTommy Flowers MBE was a senior electrical engineer and Head of the Switching Group at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill. Prior to his work on Colossus, he had been involved with GC&amp;CS at Bletchley Park from February 1941 in an attempt to improve the Bombes that were used in the cryptanalysis of the German Enigma cipher machine. He was recommended to Max Newman by Alan Turing, who had been impressed by his work on the Bombes. The main components of the Heath Robinson machine were as follows.\nFlowers had been brought in to design the Heath Robinson's combining unit. He was not impressed by the system of a key tape that had to be kept synchronised with the message tape and, on his own initiative, he designed an electronic machine which eliminated the need for the key tape by having an electronic analogue of the Lorenz (Tunny) machine. He presented this design to Max Newman in February 1943, but the idea that the one to two thousand thermionic valves (vacuum tubes and thyratrons) proposed, could work together reliably, was greeted with great scepticism, so more Robinsons were ordered from Dollis Hill. Flowers, however, knew from his pre-war work that most thermionic valve failures occurred as a result of the thermal stresses at power-up, so not powering a machine down reduced failure rates to very low levels. Additionally, if the heaters were started at a low voltage then slowly brought up to full voltage, thermal stress was reduced. The valves themselves could be soldered-in to avoid problems with plug-in bases, which could be unreliable. Flowers persisted with the idea and obtained support from the Director of the Research Station, W Gordon Radley.\nFlowers and his team of some fifty people in the switching group spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building a machine that dispensed with the second tape of the Heath Robinson, by generating the wheel patterns electronically. Flowers used some of his own money for the project. This prototype, Mark 1 Colossus, contained 1,600 thermionic valves (tubes). It performed satisfactorily at Dollis Hill on 8 December 1943 and was dismantled and shipped to Bletchley Park, where it was delivered on 18 January and re-assembled by Harry Fensom and Don Horwood. It was operational in January and it successfully attacked its first message on 5 February 1944. It was a large structure and was dubbed 'Colossus', supposedly by the WRNS operators. However, a memo held in the National Archives written by Max Newman on 18 January 1944 records that 'Colossus arrives today\".\nDuring the development of the prototype, an improved design had been developed \u2013 the Mark 2 Colossus. Four of these were ordered in March 1944 and by the end of April the number on order had been increased to twelve. Dollis Hill was put under pressure to have the first of these working by 1 June. Allen Coombs took over leadership of the production Mark 2 Colossi, the first of which \u2013 containing 2,400 valves \u2013 became operational at 08:00 on 1 June 1944, just in time for the Allied Invasion of Normandy on D-Day. Subsequently, Colossi were delivered at the rate of about one a month. By the time of V-E Day there were ten Colossi working at Bletchley Park and a start had been made on assembling an eleventh.\nThe main units of the Mark 2 design were as follows.\nMost of the design of the electronics was the work of Tommy Flowers, assisted by William Chandler, Sidney Broadhurst and Allen Coombs; with Erie Speight and Arnold Lynch developing the photoelectric reading mechanism. Coombs remembered Flowers, having produced a rough draft of his design, tearing it into pieces that he handed out to his colleagues for them to do the detailed design and get their team to manufacture it. The Mark 2 Colossi were both five times faster and were simpler to operate than the prototype.\nData input to Colossus was by photoelectric reading of a paper tape transcription of the enciphered intercepted message. This was arranged in a continuous loop so that it could be read and re-read multiple times \u2013 there being no internal storage for the data. The design overcame the problem of synchronizing the electronics with the speed of the message tape by generating a clock signal from reading its sprocket holes. The speed of operation was thus limited by the mechanics of reading the tape. During development, the tape reader was tested up to 9700 characters per second (53\u00a0mph) before the tape disintegrated. So 5000 characters/second () was settled on as the speed for regular use. Flowers designed a 6-character shift register, which was used both for computing the delta function (\u0394Z) and for testing five different possible starting points of Tunny's wheels in the five processors. This five-way parallelism enabled five simultaneous tests and counts to be performed giving an effective processing speed of 25,000 characters per second. The computation used algorithms devised by W. T. Tutte and colleagues to decrypt a Tunny message.\nOperation.\nThe Newmanry was staffed by cryptanalysts, operators from the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) \u2013 known as \"Wrens\" \u2013 and engineers who were permanently on hand for maintenance and repair. By the end of the war the staffing was 272 Wrens and 27 men.\nThe first job in operating Colossus for a new message was to prepare the paper tape loop. This was performed by the Wrens who stuck the two ends together using Bostik glue, ensuring that there was a 150-character length of blank tape between the end and the start of the message. Using a special hand punch they inserted a start hole between the third and fourth channels &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 sprocket holes from the end of the blank section, and a stop hole between the fourth and fifth channels &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 sprocket holes from the end of the characters of the message. These were read by specially positioned photocells and indicated when the message was about to start and when it ended. The operator would then thread the paper tape through the gate and around the pulleys of the bedstead and adjust the tension. The two-tape bedstead design had been carried on from Heath Robinson so that one tape could be loaded whilst the previous one was being run. A switch on the Selection Panel specified the \"near\" or the \"far\" tape.\nAfter performing various resetting and zeroizing tasks, the Wren operators would, under instruction from the cryptanalyst, operate the \"set total\" decade switches and the K2 panel switches to set the desired algorithm. They would then start the bedstead tape motor and lamp and, when the tape was up to speed, operate the master start switch.\nBy VE-Day with ten Colossi, seven were used for \"wheel setting\" and 3 for \"wheel breaking\".\nProgramming.\nHoward Campaigne, a mathematician and cryptanalyst from the US Navy's OP-20-G, wrote the following in a foreword to Flowers' 1983 paper \"The Design of Colossus\".&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My view of Colossus was that of cryptanalyst-programmer. I told the machine to make certain calculations and counts, and after studying the results, told it to do another job. It did not remember the previous result, nor could it have acted upon it if it did. Colossus and I alternated in an interaction that sometimes achieved an analysis of an unusual German cipher system, called \"Geheimschreiber\" by the Germans, and \"Fish\" by the cryptanalysts.\nColossus was not a stored-program computer. The input data for the five parallel processors was read from the looped message paper tape and the electronic pattern generators for the \"chi\", \"psi\" and motor wheels. The programs for the processors were set and held on the switches and jack panel connections. Each processor could evaluate a Boolean function and count and display the number of times it yielded the specified value of \"false\" (0) or \"true\" (1) for each pass of the message tape.\nInput to the processors came from two sources, the shift registers from tape reading and the thyratron rings that emulated the wheels of the Tunny machine. The characters on the paper tape were called Z and the characters from the Tunny emulator were referred to by the Greek letters that Bill Tutte had given them when working out the logical structure of the machine. On the selection panel, switches specified either Z or \u0394Z, either formula_2 or \u0394formula_2 and either formula_4 or \u0394formula_4 for the data to be passed to the jack field and 'K2 switch panel'. These signals from the wheel simulators could be specified as stepping on with each new pass of the message tape or not.\nThe K2 switch panel had a group of switches on the left-hand side to specify the algorithm. The switches on the right-hand side selected the counter to which the result was fed. The plugboard allowed less specialized conditions to be imposed. Overall the K2 switch panel switches and the plugboard allowed about five billion different combinations of the selected variables. \nAs an example: a set of runs for a message tape might initially involve two \"chi\" wheels, as in Tutte's 1+2 algorithm. Such a two-wheel run was called a long run, taking on average eight minutes unless the parallelism was utilised to cut the time by a factor of five. The subsequent runs might only involve setting one \"chi\" wheel, giving a short run taking about two minutes. Initially, after the initial long run, the choice of the next algorithm to be tried was specified by the cryptanalyst. Experience showed, however, that decision trees for this iterative process could be produced for use by the Wren operators in a proportion of cases.\nInfluence and fate.\nAlthough the Colossus was the first of the electronic digital machines with programmability, albeit limited by modern standards, it was not a general-purpose machine, being designed for a range of cryptanalytic tasks, most involving counting the results of evaluating Boolean algorithms.\nA Colossus computer was thus not a fully Turing complete machine. However, University of San Francisco professor Benjamin Wells has shown that if all ten Colossus machines made were rearranged in a specific cluster, then the entire set of computers could have simulated a universal Turing machine, and thus be Turing complete.\nColossus and the reasons for its construction were highly secret and remained so for 30 years after the War. Consequently, it was not included in the history of computing hardware for many years, and Flowers and his associates were deprived of the recognition they were due. Colossi 1 to 10 were dismantled after the war and parts returned to the Post Office. Some parts, sanitised as to their original purpose, were taken to Max Newman's Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at Manchester University. Tommy Flowers was ordered to destroy all documentation and burnt them in a furnace at Dollis Hill. He later said of that order:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That was a terrible mistake. I was instructed to destroy all the records, which I did. I took all the drawings and the plans and all the information about Colossus on paper and put it in the boiler fire. And saw it burn. Colossi 11 and 12, along with two replica Tunny machines, were retained, being moved to GCHQ's new headquarters at Eastcote in April 1946, and again with GCHQ to Cheltenham between 1952 and 1954. One of the Colossi, known as \"Colossus Blue\", was dismantled in 1959; the other in 1960. There had been attempts to adapt them to other purposes, with varying success; in their later years they had been used for training. Jack Good related how he was the first to use Colossus after the war, persuading the US National Security Agency that it could be used to perform a function for which they were planning to build a special-purpose machine. Colossus was also used to perform character counts on one-time pad tape to test for non-randomness.\nA small number of people who were associated with Colossus\u2014and knew that large-scale, reliable, high-speed electronic digital computing devices were feasible\u2014played significant roles in early computer work in the UK and probably in the US. However, being so secret, it had little direct influence on the development of later computers; it was EDVAC that was the seminal computer architecture of the time. In 1972, Herman Goldstine, who was unaware of Colossus and its legacy to the projects of people such as Alan Turing (ACE), Max Newman (Manchester computers) and Harry Huskey (Bendix G-15), wrote that,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Britain had such vitality that it could immediately after the war embark on so many well-conceived and well-executed projects in the computer field.\nProfessor Brian Randell, who unearthed information about Colossus in the 1970s, commented on this, saying that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is my opinion that the COLOSSUS project was an important source of this vitality, one that has been largely unappreciated, as has the significance of its places in the chronology of the invention of the digital computer.\nRandell's efforts started to bear fruit in the mid-1970s. The secrecy about Bletchley Park had been broken when Group Captain Winterbotham published his book \"The Ultra Secret\" in 1974. Randell was researching the history of computer science in Britain for a conference on the history of computing held at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, New Mexico on 10-15 June 1976, and got permission to present a paper on wartime development of the COLOSSI at the Post Office Research Station, Dollis Hill (in October 1975 the British Government had released a series of captioned photographs from the Public Record Office). The interest in the \u201crevelations\u201d in his paper resulted in a special evening meeting when Randell and Coombs answered further questions. Coombs later wrote that \"no member of our team could ever forget the fellowship, the sense of purpose and, above all, the breathless excitement of those days\". In 1977 Randell published an article \"The First Electronic Computer\" in several journals. \nIn October 2000, a 500-page technical report on the Tunny cipher and its cryptanalysis\u2014entitled \"General Report on Tunny\"\u2014was released by GCHQ to the national Public Record Office, and it contains a fascinating paean to Colossus by the cryptographers who worked with it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is regretted that it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the fascination of a Colossus at work; its sheer bulk and apparent complexity; the fantastic speed of thin paper tape round the glittering pulleys; the childish pleasure of not-not, span, print main header and other gadgets; the wizardry of purely mechanical decoding letter by letter (one novice thought she was being hoaxed); the uncanny action of the typewriter in printing the correct scores without and beyond human aid; the stepping of the display; periods of eager expectation culminating in the sudden appearance of the longed-for score; and the strange rhythms characterizing every type of run: the stately break-in, the erratic short run, the regularity of wheel-breaking, the stolid rectangle interrupted by the wild leaps of the carriage-return, the frantic chatter of a motor run, even the ludicrous frenzy of hosts of bogus scores.\nReconstruction.\nConstruction of a fully functional rebuild of a Colossus Mark 2 was undertaken between 1993 and 2008 by a team led by Tony Sale. In spite of the blueprints and hardware being destroyed, a surprising amount of material survived, mainly in engineers' notebooks, but a considerable amount of it in the U.S. The optical tape reader might have posed the biggest problem, but Dr. Arnold Lynch, its original designer was able to redesign it to his own original specification. The reconstruction is on display, in the historically correct place for Colossus No. 9, at The National Museum of Computing, in H Block Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.\nIn November 2007, to celebrate the project completion and to mark the start of a fundraising initiative for The National Museum of Computing, a Cipher Challenge pitted the rebuilt Colossus against radio amateurs worldwide in being first to receive and decode three messages enciphered using the Lorenz SZ42 and transmitted from radio station DL0HNF in the \"Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum\" computer museum. The challenge was easily won by radio amateur Joachim Sch\u00fcth, who had carefully prepared for the event and developed his own signal processing and code-breaking code using Ada. The Colossus team were hampered by their wish to use World War II radio equipment, delaying them by a day because of poor reception conditions. Nevertheless, the victor's 1.4\u00a0GHz laptop, running his own code, took less than a minute to find the settings for all 12 wheels. The German codebreaker said: \"My laptop digested ciphertext at a speed of 1.2\u00a0million characters per second\u2014240 times faster than Colossus. If you scale the CPU frequency by that factor, you get an equivalent clock of 5.8\u00a0MHz for Colossus. That is a remarkable speed for a computer built in 1944.\"\nThe Cipher Challenge verified the successful completion of the rebuild project. \"On the strength of today's performance Colossus is as good as it was six decades ago\", commented Tony Sale. \"We are delighted to have produced a fitting tribute to the people who worked at Bletchley Park and whose brainpower devised these fantastic machines which broke these ciphers and shortened the war by many months.\"\nOther meanings.\nThere was a fictional computer named \"Colossus\" in the 1970 film \"\" which was based on the 1966 novel \"Colossus\" by D. F. Jones. This was a coincidence as it pre-dates the public release of information about Colossus, or even its name.\nNeal Stephenson's novel \"Cryptonomicon\" (1999) also contains a fictional treatment of the historical role played by Turing and Bletchley Park.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA guided tour of the history and geography of the Park, written by one of the founder members of the Bletchley Park Trust"}
{"id": "6230", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6230", "title": "Canadian Shield", "text": "Geographic and geologic area of North America\nThe Canadian Shield ( ]), also called the Laurentian Plateau, is a geologic shield, a large area of exposed Precambrian igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. It forms the North American Craton (or Laurentia), the ancient geologic core of the North American continent. Glaciation has left the area with only a thin layer of soil, through which exposures of igneous bedrock resulting from its long volcanic history are frequently visible. As a deep, common, joined bedrock region in eastern and central Canada, the Shield stretches north from the Great Lakes to the Arctic Ocean, covering over half of Canada and most of Greenland; it also extends south into the northern reaches of the United States.\nGeographical extent.\nThe Canadian Shield is a physiographic division comprising four smaller physiographic provinces: the Laurentian Upland, Kazan Region, Davis and James. The shield extends into the United States as the Adirondack Mountains (connected by the Frontenac Axis) and the Superior Upland. The Canadian Shield is a U-shaped subsection of the Laurentia craton signifying the area of greatest glacial impact (scraping down to bare rock) creating the thin soils. The age of the Canadian Shield is estimated to be 4.28 Ga. The Canadian Shield once had jagged peaks, higher than any of today's mountains, but millions of years of erosion have changed these mountains to rolling hills.\nThe Canadian Shield is a collage of Archean plates and accreted juvenile arc terranes and sedimentary basins of the Proterozoic Eon that were progressively amalgamated during the interval 2.45\u20131.24 Ga, with the most substantial growth period occurring during the Trans-Hudson orogeny, between c. 1.90\u20131.80 Ga. The Canadian Shield was the first part of North America to be permanently elevated above sea level and has remained almost wholly untouched by successive encroachments of the sea upon the continent. It is the Earth's greatest area of exposed Archean rock. The metamorphic base rocks are mostly from the Precambrian (between 4.5 billion and 540 million years ago) and have been repeatedly uplifted and eroded. Today it consists largely of an area of low relief above sea level with a few monadnocks and low mountain ranges (including the Laurentian Mountains) probably eroded from the plateau during the Cenozoic Era. During the Pleistocene Epoch, continental ice sheets depressed the land surface (creating Hudson Bay) but also tilted up its northeastern \"rim\" (the Torngat), scooped out thousands of lake basins, and carried away much of the region's soil. The northeastern portion, however, became tilted up so that, in northern Labrador and Baffin Island, the land rises to more than 1,500 metres (5,000 feet) above sea level.\nWhen the Greenland section is included, the Canadian Shield is approximately circular, bounded on the northeast by the northeast edge of Greenland, with Hudson Bay in the middle. It covers much of Greenland, all of Labrador and the Great Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland, most of Quebec north of the St. Lawrence River, much of Ontario including northern sections of the Ontario Peninsula, the Adirondack Mountains of New York, the northernmost part of Lower Michigan and all of Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, northeastern Minnesota, the central and northern portions of Manitoba away from Hudson Bay, northern Saskatchewan, a small portion of northeastern Alberta, mainland Northwest Territories to the east of a line extended north from the Saskatchewan-Alberta border, most of Nunavut's mainland and, of its Arctic Archipelago, Baffin Island and significant bands through Somerset, Southampton, Devon and Ellesmere islands. In total, the exposed area of the Shield covers approximately . The true extent of the Shield is greater still and stretches from the Western Cordillera in the west to the Appalachians in the east and as far south as Texas, but these regions are overlaid with much younger rocks and sediment.\nGeology.\nThe Canadian Shield is among the oldest on Earth, with regions dating from 2.5 to 4.2 billion years. The multitude of rivers and lakes in the region is classical example of a deranged drainage system, caused by the watersheds of the area being disturbed by glaciation and the effect of post-glacial rebound. The Shield was originally an area of very large, very tall mountains (about ) with much volcanic activity, but the area was eroded to nearly its current topographic appearance of relatively low relief over 500 million years ago. Erosion has exposed the roots of the mountains, which take the form of greenstone belts in which belts of volcanic rock that have been altered by metamorphism are surrounded by granitic rock. These belts range in age from 3600 to 2680 million years old. Much of the granitic rock belongs to the distinctive tonalite\u2013trondhjemite\u2013granodiorite family of rocks, which are characteristic of Archean continental crust. Many of Canada's major ore deposits are associated with greenstone belts.\nThe Sturgeon Lake Caldera in Kenora District, Ontario, is one of the world's best preserved mineralized Neoarchean caldera complexes, which is 2.7 billion years old. The Canadian Shield also contains the Mackenzie dike swarm, which is the largest dike swarm known on Earth.\nMountains have deep roots and float on the denser mantle much like an iceberg at sea. As mountains erode, their roots rise and are eroded in turn. The rocks that now form the surface of the Shield were once far below the Earth's surface.\nThe high pressures and temperatures at those depths provided ideal conditions for mineralization. Although these mountains are now heavily eroded, many large mountains still exist in Canada's far north called the Arctic Cordillera. This is a vast, deeply dissected mountain range, stretching from northernmost Ellesmere Island to the northernmost tip of Labrador. The range's highest peak is Nunavut's Barbeau Peak at above sea level. Precambrian rock is the major component of the bedrock.\nThe North American craton is the bedrock forming the heart of the North American continent and the Canadian Shield is the largest exposed part of the craton's bedrock.\nThe Canadian Shield is part of an ancient continent called Arctica, which was formed about 2.5 billion years ago during the Neoarchean era. It was split into Greenland, Laurentia, Scotland, and Siberia, and is now roughly situated in the Arctic around the current North Pole.\nEcology.\nThe current surface expression of the Shield is one of very thin soil lying on top of the bedrock, with many bare outcrops. This arrangement was caused by severe glaciation during the ice age, which covered the Shield and scraped the rock clean.\nThe lowlands of the Canadian Shield have a very dense soil that is not suitable for forestation; it also contains many marshes and bogs (muskegs). The rest of the region has coarse soil that does not retain moisture well and is frozen with permafrost throughout the year. Forests are not as dense in the north.\nThe Shield is covered in parts by vast boreal forests in the south that support natural ecosystems as well as a major logging industry. The boreal forest area gives way to the Eastern Canadian Shield taiga that covers northern Quebec and most of Labrador. The Midwestern Canadian Shield forests that run westwards from Northwestern Ontario have boreal forests that give way to taiga in the most northerly parts of Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Hydrologic drainage is generally poor, the soil compacting effects of glaciation being one of the many causes. Tundra typically prevails in the northern regions. Many mammals such as caribou, white-tailed deer, moose, wolves, wolverines, weasels, mink, otters, grizzly bear, polar bears and black bears are present. In the case of polar bears (), the Shield area contains many of their denning locations, such as the Wapusk National Park.\nMining and economics.\nThe Canadian Shield is one of the world's richest areas in terms of mineral ores. It is filled with substantial deposits of nickel, gold, silver, and copper. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and one of the best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. Ejecta from the meteorite impact was found in the Rove Formation in May 2007. The nearby but less-known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. This suggests it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.\nIn northeastern Quebec, the giant Manicouagan Reservoir is the site of an extensive hydroelectric project (Manic-cinq, or Manic-5). This is one of the largest-known meteorite impact craters on Earth, though not as large as the Sudbury crater; it is currently ranked 5th, while Sudbury is 3rd. \nThe Flin Flon greenstone belt in central Manitoba and east-central Saskatchewan \"is one of the largest Paleoproterozoic volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VMS) districts in the world, containing 27 copper-zinc-(gold) deposits from which more than 183 million tonnes of sulfide have been mined.\"\nThe Canadian Shield, particularly the portion in the Northwest Territories, has recently been the site of several major diamond discoveries. The kimberlite pipes in which the diamonds are found are closely associated with cratons, which provide the deep lithospheric mantle required to stabilize diamond as a mineral. The kimberlite eruptions then bring the diamonds from over depth to the surface. The Ekati and Diavik mines are actively mining kimberlite diamonds.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6231", "revid": "46051363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6231", "title": "Comic book", "text": "Publication of comics art\nA comic book, also called comicbook, comic magazine or (in the United Kingdom and Ireland) simply comic, is a publication that consists of comics art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by descriptive prose and written narrative, usually, dialogue contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. \n\"Comic Cuts\" was a British comic published from 1890 to 1953. It was preceded by \"Ally Sloper's Half Holiday\" (1884) which is notable for its use of sequential cartoons to unfold narrative. These British comics existed alongside the popular lurid \"Penny dreadfuls\" (such as \"Spring-heeled Jack\"), boys' \"Story papers\" and the humorous Punch (magazine) which was the first to use the term \"cartoon\" in its modern sense of a humorous drawing. The interweaving of drawings and the written word had been pioneered by, among others, William Blake (1757 - 1857) in works such as Blake's \"The Descent Of Christ\" (1804 - 1820).\nThe first modern (American style) comic book, \"Famous Funnies\", was released in the US in 1934 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \"comic book\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.\nThe largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the manga market in Japan was valued at \u00a5 ($), with annual sales of 1.9billion manga books (tank\u014dbon volumes and manga magazines) in Japan, equivalent to 15issues per person. In 2020 the manga market in Japan reached a new record value of \u00a5612.5 billion due to a fast growth of digital manga sales as well as an increase in print sales. The comic book market in the United States and Canada was valued at $ in 2016. As of 2017[ [update]], the largest comic book publisher in the United States is manga distributor Viz Media, followed by DC Comics and Marvel Comics the original feature full length special edition franchises including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk and the X-Men. The best-selling comic book categories in the US as of 2019[ [update]] are juvenile children's fiction at 41%, manga at 28% and superhero comics at 10% of the market. Another major comic book market is France, where Franco-Belgian comics and Japanese manga each represent 40% of the market, followed by American comics at 10% market share.\nStructure.\nComic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a tail element. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring. There are many technological formulas used to create comic books, including directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring. In the United States, the term \"comic book\", is generally used for comics periodicals and trade paperbacks while \"graphic novel\" is the term used for standalone books.\nAmerican comic books.\nComics as a print medium have existed in the United States since the printing of \"The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck\" in 1842 in hardcover, making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with the first comic standard-sized comic being \"Funnies on Parade\". \"Funnies on Parades\" was the first book that established the size, duration, and format of the modern comic book. Following this was, Dell Publishing's 36-page \"Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics\" as the first true newsstand American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it \"the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing\". In 1905 G.W. Dillingham Company published 24 select strips by the cartoonist Gustave Verbeek in an anthology book called 'The Incredible Upside-Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo'. The introduction of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's Superman in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry and ushered in the Golden Age of Comic Books. The Golden Age originated the archetype of the superhero. According to historian Michael A. Amundson, appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.\nHistorians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The Golden Age of Comic Books began in 1938, with the debut of Superman in Action Comics #1, published by Detective Comics (predecessor of DC Comics), which is generally considered the beginning of the modern comic book as it is known today. The Silver Age of Comic Books is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the Flash in \"Showcase\" #4 (Oct. 1956). The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time Marvel Comics revolutionized the medium with such naturalistic superheroes as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Fantastic Four and Lee and Steve Ditko's Spider-Man. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the Bronze Age of Comic Books, is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s. The Modern Age of Comic Books runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.\nA notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist Fredric Wertham's criticisms of the medium in his book \"Seduction of the Innocent\" (1954), which prompted the American Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency to investigate comic books. Wertham claimed that comic books were responsible for an increase in juvenile delinquency, as well as potential influence on a child's sexuality and morals. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the US comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America. The CMAA instilled the Comics Code Authority in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA. The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.\nUnderground comic books.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as underground comics. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth counterculture and drug culture of the time. Underground comix \"reflected and commented on the social divisions and tensions of American society\". Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure \"Tijuana bibles\". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as head shops and record stores, as well as by mail order. The underground comics encouraged creators to publish their work independently so that they would have full ownership rights to their characters.\nFrank Stack's \"The Adventures of Jesus\", published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon, has been credited as the first underground comic; while R. Crumb and the crew of cartoonists who worked on \"Zap Comix\" popularized the form.\nAlternative comics.\nThe rise of comic book specialty stores in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for \"independent\" or \"alternative comics\" in the US. The first such comics included the anthology series \"Star Reach\", published by comic book writer Mike Friedrich from 1974 to 1979, and Harvey Pekar's \"American Splendor\", which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini adapted into a 2003 film. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably \"RAW\") represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of fine art.\nDuring the 1970s the \"small press\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers \u2013 such as Pacific, Eclipse, First, , and Fantagraphics \u2013 had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats\u2014from color-superhero, detective, and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of Latin American magical realism.\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"minicomics\" form, an extremely informal version of self-publishing, arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s, despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include Avatar Press, Hyperwerks, Raytoons, and Terminal Press, buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital print-on-demand.\nGraphic novels.\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\". \nPrecursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the medieval woodcut tradition by Belgian Frans Masereel, American Lynd Ward and others, including Stan Lee.\nIn 1947 Fawcett Publications published \"Comics Novel No. 1\", as the first in an intended series of these \"comics novels\". The story in the first issue was \"Anarcho, Dictator of Death\", a five chapter spy genre tale written by Otto Binder and drawn by Al Carreno. It is readable online in the Digital Comic Museum. The magazine never reached a second issue. \nIn 1950 St. John Publications produced the digest-sized, adult-oriented \"picture novel\" \"It Rhymes with Lust\", a 128-page digest by pseudonymous writer \"Drake Waller\" (Arnold Drake and Leslie Waller), penciler Matt Baker and inker Ray Osrin, touted as \"an original full-length novel\" on its cover. \"It Rhymes with Lust\" is also available to read online in the Digital Comic Museum.\nIn 1971, writer-artist Gil Kane and collaborators applied a paperback format to their \"comics novel\" \"Blackmark\". Will Eisner popularized the term \"graphic novel\" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work \"A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories\" in 1978 and, subsequently, the usage of the term began to increase.\nMarket size.\nIn 2017, the comic book market size for North America was just over $1\u00a0billion with digital sales being flat, book stores having a 1 percent decline, and comic book stores having a 10 percent decline over 2016. The global comic book market size increased by 12% in 2020 to reach USD 8.49 billion. In 2021, the annual valuation of the market amounted to USD 9.21 billion. The popularity of the product is soaring across the world, led by collaborative efforts being made between brands to deliver more appealing comic content.\nComic book collecting.\nThe 1970s saw the advent of specialty comic book stores. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of comic book conventions, they are now embraced by many adults.\nComic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title. Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title. For example, Spider-Man's first appearance was in \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15. New characters were often introduced this way and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the first issue of a character's own title.\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased \"Motion Picture Funnies Weekly\" #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The \"Pay Copy\" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 Heritage auction.\nThe most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over US$1\u00a0million as of December\u00a02010[ [update]], including two examples of \"Action Comics\" #1, the first appearance of Superman, both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and \"Detective Comics\" #27, the first appearance of Batman, via public auction.\nUpdating the above price obtained for \"Action Comics\" #1, the first appearance of Superman, the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2\u00a0million, for a 9.0 copy. \nMisprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the original press run of \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" #5, which DC executive Paul Levitz recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage Victorian era advertisement for \"Marvel Douche\", which the publisher considered offensive; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been CGC graded. (See Recalled comics for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\nIn 2000, a company named Comics Guaranty (CGC) began to \"slab\" comics, encasing them in thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. Since then, other grading companies have arisen. Because condition is important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.\nThe original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published. These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.\nWhen the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art. The original pages of DC and Marvel the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Hulk and Spider-Man are considered priceless.\nHistory of race in U.S. comic books.\nMany early iterations of black characters in comics \"became variations on the 'single stereotypical image of Sambo'.\" Sambo was closely related to the coon stereotype but had some subtle differences. They are both a derogatory way of portraying black characters. \"The name itself, an abbreviation of raccoon, is dehumanizing. As with Sambo, the coon was portrayed as a lazy, easily frightened, chronically idle, inarticulate, buffoon.\" This portrayal \"was of course another attempt to solidify the intellectual inferiority of the black race through popular culture.\" However, in the 1940s there was a change in portrayal of black characters. \"A cursory glance...might give the impression that situations had improved for African Americans in comics.\" In many comics being produced in this time there was a major push for tolerance between races. \"These equality minded heroes began to spring to action just as African Americans were being asked to participate in the war effort.\"\nDuring this time, a government ran program, the Writers' War Board, became heavily involved in what would be published in comics. \"The Writers' War Board used comic books to shape popular perceptions of race and ethnicity...\" Not only were they using comic books as a means of recruiting all Americans, they were also using it as propaganda to \"[construct] a justification for race-based hatred of America's foreign enemies.\" The Writers' War Board created comics books that were meant to \"[promote] domestic racial harmony\". However, \"these pro-tolerance narratives struggled to overcome the popular and widely understood negative tropes used for decades in American mass culture...\". However, they were not accomplishing this agenda within all of their comics.\nIn \"Captain Marvel Adventures\", a character named Steamboat was an amalgamation of some of the worst stereotypes of the time. The Writers' War Board did not ask for any change with this character. \"Eliminating Steamboat required the determined efforts of a black youth group in New York City.\" Originally their request was refused by individuals working on the comic stating, \"\"Captain Marvel Adventures\" included many kinds of caricatures 'for the sake of humor'.\" The black youth group responded with \"this is not the Negro race, but your one-and-a-half millions readers will think it so.\" Afterwards, Steamboat disappeared from the comics all together. There was a comic created about the 99th Squadron, also known as the Tuskegee Airmen, an all-black air force unit. Instead of making the comic about their story, the comic was about Hop Harrigan. A white pilot who captures a Nazi, shows him videos of the 99th Squadron defeating his men and then reveals to the Nazi that his men were defeated by African Americans which infuriated him as he sees them as a less superior race and cannot believe they bested his men.\"The Tuskegee Airmen, and images of black aviators appear in just three of the fifty three panels... the pilots of the 99th Squadron have no dialogue and interact with neither Hop Harrigan nor his Nazi captive.\" During this time, they also used black characters in comic books as a means to invalidate the militant black groups that were fighting for equality within the U.S. \"Spider-Man 'made it clear that militant black power was not the remedy for racial injustice'.\" \"The Falcon openly criticized black behavior stating' maybe it's important fo [\"sic\"] us to cool things down-so we can protect the rights we been fightin' for'.\" This portrayal and character development of black characters can be partially blamed on the fact that, during this time, \"there had rarely been a black artist or writer allowed in a major comics company.\"\nAsian characters faced some of the same treatment in comics as black characters did. They were dehumanized and the narrative being pushed was that they were \"incompetent and subhuman.\" \"A 1944 issue of the \"United States Marines\" included a narrative entitled \"The Smell of the Monkeymen\". The story depicts Japanese soldiers as simian brutes whose sickening body odor betrays their concealed locations.\" Chinese characters received the same treatment. \"By the time the United States entered WWII, negative perceptions of Chinese were an established part of mass culture...\" However, concerned that the Japanese could use America's anti-Chinese material as propaganda they began \"to present a more positive image of America's Chinese allies...\" Just as they tried to show better representation for Black people in comics they did the same for Asian people. However, \"Japanese and Filipino characters were visually indistinguishable. Both groups have grotesque buckteeth, tattered clothing, and bright yellow skin.\" \"Publishers depicted America's Asian allies through derogatory images and language honed over the preceding decades.\" Asian characters were previously portrayed as, \"ghastly yellow demons\". During WWII, \"[every] major superhero worth his spandex devoted himself to the eradication of Asian invaders.\" There was \"a constant relay race in which one Asian culture merely handed off the baton of hatred to another with no perceptible changes in the manner in which the characters would be portrayed.\"\n\"The only specific depiction of a Hispanic superhero did not end well. In 1975 Marvel gave us Hector Ayala (a.k.a The White Tiger).\" \"Although he fought for several years alongside the likes of much more popular heroes such as Spider-Man and Daredevil, he only lasted six years before sales of comics featuring him got so bad that Marvel had him retire. The most famous Hispanic character is Bane, a villain from Batman.\"\nThe Native American representation in comic books \"can be summed up in the noble savage stereotype\" \" a recurring theme...urged American indians to abandon their traditional hostility towards the United States. They were the ones painted as intolerant and disrespectful of the dominant concerns of white America\".\nEast Asian comics.\nJapanese manga.\nManga (\u6f2b\u753b) are comic books or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, though the art form has a long prehistory in earlier Japanese art. The term \"manga\" is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning in general . Outside Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics originally published in the country.\nD\u014djinshi.\n, fan-made Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American \"underground comics\" market; the largest d\u014djinshi fair, Comiket, attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.\nKorean manhwa.\nManhwa (\ub9cc\ud654) are comic books or graphic novels originating from South Korea. The term \"manhwa\" is used in South Korea to refer to both comics and cartooning in general. Outside South Korea, the term usually refers to comics originally published in the country. Manhwa is greatly influenced by Japanese Manga comics though it differs from manga and manhua with its own distinct features.\nWebtoons.\nWebtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More manhwa have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.\nEuropean comics.\nFranco-Belgian comics.\nFrance and Belgium have a long tradition in comics and comic books, often called \"BDs\" (an abbreviation of \"bandes dessin\u00e9es\", meaning literally \"drawn strips\") in French, and \"strips\" in Dutch or Flemish. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics but have their own distinct style.\nBritish comics.\nAlthough \"Ally Sloper's Half Holiday\" (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. \"The Guardian\" refers to Ally Sloper as \"one of the world's first iconic cartoon characters\", and \"as famous in Victorian Britain as Dennis the Menace would be a century later.\" British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated penny dreadfuls of the Victorian era (featuring Sweeney Todd, Dick Turpin and \"Varney the Vampire\"). First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls were \"Britain's first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.\"\nThe two most popular British comic books, \"The Beano\" and \"The Dandy\", were first published by DC Thomson in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million. Explaining the enormous popularity of comics in the UK during this period, Anita O'Brien, director curator at London's Cartoon Museum, states: \"When comics like the Beano and Dandy were invented back in the 1930s \u2013 and through really to the 1950s and 60s \u2013 these comics were almost the only entertainment available to children.\" \"Dennis the Menace\" was created in the 1950s, which saw sales for \"The Beano\" soar. He features in the cover of \"The Beano\", with the BBC referring to him as the \"definitive naughty boy of the comic world.\"\nIn 1954, \"Tiger\" comics introduced \"Roy of the Rovers\", the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of Roy Race and the team he played for, Melchester Rovers. The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark. Other comic books such as \"Eagle\", \"Valiant\", \"Warrior\", \"Viz\" and \"2000 AD\" also flourished. Some comics, such as \"Judge Dredd\" and other \"2000 AD\" titles, have been published in a tabloid form. Underground comics and \"small press\" titles have also appeared in the UK, notably \"Oz\" and \"Escape Magazine\".\nThe content of \"Action\", another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the House of Commons. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the US, such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the US. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's Captain Marvel, and other characters such as Sheena, Mandrake the Magician, and the Phantom. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe &amp; Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although \"The Adventures of Tintin\" and \"Asterix\" serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books. The number of European comics available in the UK has increased in the last two decades. The British company Cinebook, founded in 2005, has released English translated versions of many European series.\nIn the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the \"British Invasion\" in comic book history. These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media. These elements would pave the way for mature and \"darker and edgier\" comic books and jump start the Modern Age of Comics. Writers included Alan Moore, famous for his \"V for Vendetta\", \"From Hell\", \"Watchmen\", \"Marvelman\", and \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\"; Neil Gaiman with \"The Sandman\" mythos and \"Books of Magic\"; Warren Ellis, creator of \"Transmetropolitan\" and \"Planetary\"; and others such as Mark Millar, creator of \"Wanted\" and \"Kick-Ass\". The comic book series \"John Constantine, Hellblazer\", which is largely set in Britain and starring the magician John Constantine, paved the way for British writers such as Jamie Delano.\nThe English musician Peter Gabriel issued in 2000 The Story of OVO which was released in a CD-booklet-shaped comic book as part of the CD edition with the title \"OVO The Millennium Show\". The 2000 Millennium Dome Show based on it.\nAt Christmas, publishers repackage and commission material for comic annuals, printed and bound as hardcover A4-size books; \"Rupert\" supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. DC Thomson also repackages \"The Broons\" and \"Oor Wullie\" strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.\nOn 19 March 2012, the British postal service, the Royal Mail, released a set of stamps depicting British comic book characters and series. The collection featured \"The Beano\", \"The Dandy\", \"Eagle\", \"The Topper\", \"Roy of the Rovers\", \"Bunty\", \"Buster\", \"Valiant\", \"Twinkle\" and \"2000 AD\".\nSpanish comics.\nIt has been stated that the 13th century \"Cantigas de Santa Mar\u00eda\" could be considered as the first Spanish \"comic\", although comic books (also known in Spain as \"historietas\" or \"tebeos\") made their debut around 1857. The magazine \"TBO\" was influential in popularizing the medium. After the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime imposed strict censorship in all media: superhero comics were forbidden and as a result, comic heroes were based on historical fiction (in 1944 the medieval hero \"El Guerrero del Antifaz\" was created by Manuel Gago and another popular medieval hero, \"Capit\u00e1n Trueno\", was created in 1956 by V\u00edctor Mora and Miguel Ambrosio Zaragoza). Two publishing houses \u2014 Editorial Bruguera and Editorial Valenciana \u2014 dominated the Spanish comics market during its golden age (1950\u20131970). The most popular comics showed a recognizable style of slapstick humor (influenced by Franco-Belgian authors such as Franquin): Escobar's \"Carpanta\" and \"Zipi y Zape\", V\u00e1zquez's \"Las hermanas Gilda\" and \"Anacleto,\" Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez's \"Mortadelo y Filem\u00f3n\" and \"13. Rue del Percebe\" or Jan's \"Superl\u00f3pez\". After the end of the Francoist period, there was an increased interest in adult comics with magazines such as \"Totem\", \"El Jueves\", \"1984\", and \"El V\u00edbora,\" and works such as \"Paracuellos\" by Carlos Gim\u00e9nez.\nSpanish artists have traditionally worked in other markets finding great success, either in the American (e.g., Eisner Award winners Sergio Aragon\u00e9s, Salvador Larroca, Gabriel Hern\u00e1ndez Walta, Marcos Mart\u00edn or David Aja), the British (e.g., Carlos Ezquerra, co-creator of \"Judge Dredd\") or the Franco-Belgian one (e.g., Fauve d'Or winner or \"Blacksad\" authors Juan D\u00edaz Canales and Juanjo Guarnido).\nItalian comics.\nIn Italy, comics (known in Italian as \"fumetti\") made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like Hugo Pratt and Guido Crepax exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as \"Diabolik\" or the \"Bonelli\" line\u2014namely \"Tex Willer\" or \"Dylan Dog\"\u2014remain best-sellers.\nMainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white digest size format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's \"Corto Maltese\".\nItalian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and Argentina. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of Walt Disney comic stories outside the US; Donald Duck's superhero alter ego, Paperinik, known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.\nDistribution.\nDistribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The smartphone and the tablet have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.\nDigital distribution.\nOn 13 November 2007, Marvel Comics launched Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited, a subscription service allowing readers to read many comics from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of \"Avenging Spider-Man\" #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.\nWith the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is comiXology. Some platforms, such as Graphicly, have shut down.\nComic collections in libraries.\nMany libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.\nGuinness World Records.\nIn 2015, the Japanese manga artist Eiichiro Oda was awarded the \"Guinness World Records\" title for having the \"Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". His manga series \"One Piece\", which he writes and illustrates, has been serialized in the Japanese magazine \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump\" since December 1997, and by 2015, 77 collected volumes had been released. \"Guinness World Records\" reported in their announcement that the collected volumes of the series had sold a total of 320,866,000 units. \"One Piece\" also holds the \"Guinness World Records\" title for \"Most copies published for the same manga series\".\nOn 5 August 2018, the \"Guinness World Records\" title for the \"Largest comic book ever published\" was awarded to the Brazilian comic book \"Turma da M\u00f4nica \u2014 O Maior Gibi do Mundo!\", published by Panini Comics Brasil and Mauricio de Sousa Produ\u00e7\u00f5es. The comic book measures 69.9\u00a0cm by 99.8\u00a0cm (2\u00a0ft 3.51 in by 3\u00a0ft 3.29 in). The 18-page comic book had a print run of 120 copies.\nWith the July 2021 publication of the 201st collected volume of his manga series \"Golgo 13\", Japanese manga artist Takao Saito was awarded the \"Guinness World Records\" title for \"Most volumes published for a single manga series.\" \"Golgo 13\" has been continuously serialized in the Japanese magazine \"Big Comic\" since October 1968, which also makes it the oldest manga still in publication.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6233", "revid": "42462595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6233", "title": "Connected space", "text": "Topological space that is connected\nIn topology and related branches of mathematics, a connected space is a topological space that cannot be represented as the union of two or more disjoint non-empty open subsets. Connectedness is one of the principal topological properties that are used to distinguish topological spaces.\nA subset of a topological space formula_1 is a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;connected set if it is a connected space when viewed as a subspace of formula_1.\nSome related but stronger conditions are path connected, simply connected, and formula_3-connected. Another related notion is \"locally connected\", which neither implies nor follows from connectedness.\nFormal definition.\nA topological space formula_1 is said to be &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;disconnected if it is the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. Otherwise, formula_1 is said to be connected. A subset of a topological space is said to be connected if it is connected under its subspace topology. Some authors exclude the empty set (with its unique topology) as a connected space, but this article does not follow that practice.\nFor a topological space formula_1 the following conditions are equivalent:\nHistorically this modern formulation of the notion of connectedness (in terms of no partition of formula_1 into two separated sets) first appeared (independently) with N.J. Lennes, Frigyes Riesz, and Felix Hausdorff at the beginning of the 20th century. See for details.\nConnected components.\nGiven some point formula_17 in a topological space formula_18 the union of any collection of connected subsets such that each contains formula_17 will once again be a connected subset. \nThe connected component of a point formula_17 in formula_1 is the union of all connected subsets of formula_1 that contain formula_23 it is the unique largest (with respect to formula_24) connected subset of formula_1 that contains formula_26 \nThe maximal connected subsets (ordered by inclusion formula_24) of a non-empty topological space are called the connected components of the space.\nThe components of any topological space formula_1 form a partition of\u00a0formula_1: they are disjoint, non-empty and their union is the whole space.\nEvery component is a closed subset of the original space. It follows that, in the case where their number is finite, each component is also an open subset. However, if their number is infinite, this might not be the case; for instance, the connected components of the set of the rational numbers are the one-point sets (singletons), which are not open. Proof: Any two distinct rational numbers formula_30 are in different components. Take an irrational number formula_31 and then set formula_32 and formula_33 Then formula_34 is a separation of formula_35 and formula_36. Thus each component is a one-point set.\nLet formula_37 be the connected component of formula_17 in a topological space formula_18 and formula_40 be the intersection of all clopen sets containing formula_17 (called quasi-component of formula_26) Then formula_43 where the equality holds if formula_1 is compact Hausdorff or locally connected.\nDisconnected spaces.\nA space in which all components are one-point sets is called &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;totally disconnected. Related to this property, a space formula_1 is called &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;totally separated if, for any two distinct elements formula_17 and formula_47 of formula_1, there exist disjoint open sets formula_49 containing formula_17 and formula_51 containing formula_47 such that formula_1 is the union of formula_49 and formula_51. Clearly, any totally separated space is totally disconnected, but the converse does not hold. For example take two copies of the rational numbers formula_56, and identify them at every point except zero. The resulting space, with the quotient topology, is totally disconnected. However, by considering the two copies of zero, one sees that the space is not totally separated. In fact, it is not even Hausdorff, and the condition of being totally separated is strictly stronger than the condition of being Hausdorff.\nExamples.\nAn example of a space that is not connected is a plane with an infinite line deleted from it. Other examples of disconnected spaces (that is, spaces which are not connected) include the plane with an annulus removed, as well as the union of two disjoint closed disks, where all examples of this paragraph bear the subspace topology induced by two-dimensional Euclidean space.\nPath connectedness.\nA &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;path-connected space is a stronger notion of connectedness, requiring the structure of a path. A path from a point formula_17 to a point formula_47 in a topological space formula_1 is a continuous function formula_89 from the unit interval formula_90 to formula_1 with formula_92 and formula_93. A &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;path-component of formula_1 is an equivalence class of formula_1 under the equivalence relation which makes formula_17 equivalent to formula_47 if there is a path from formula_17 to formula_47. The space formula_1 is said to be path-connected (or pathwise connected or formula_101-connected) if there is exactly one path-component, i.e. if there is a path joining any two points in formula_1. Again, many authors exclude the empty space (by this definition, however, the empty space is not path-connected because it has zero path-components; there is a unique equivalence relation on the empty set which has zero equivalence classes).\nEvery path-connected space is connected. The converse is not always true: examples of connected spaces that are not path-connected include the extended long line formula_103 and the topologist's sine curve.\nSubsets of the real line formula_67 are connected if and only if they are path-connected; these subsets are the intervals of formula_67.\nAlso, open subsets of formula_65 or formula_107 are connected if and only if they are path-connected.\nAdditionally, connectedness and path-connectedness are the same for finite topological spaces.\nArc connectedness.\nA space formula_1 is said to be arc-connected or arcwise connected if any two topologically distinguishable points can be joined by an arc, which is an embedding formula_109. An arc-component of formula_1 is a maximal arc-connected subset of formula_1; or equivalently an equivalence class of the equivalence relation of whether two points can be joined by an arc or by a path whose points are topologically indistinguishable.\nEvery Hausdorff space that is path-connected is also arc-connected; more generally this is true for a formula_112-Hausdorff space, which is a space where each image of a path is closed. An example of a space which is path-connected but not arc-connected is given by the line with two origins; its two copies of formula_113 can be connected by a path but not by an arc.\nIntuition for path-connected spaces does not readily transfer to arc-connected spaces. Let formula_1 be the line with two origins. The following are facts whose analogues hold for path-connected spaces, but do not hold for arc-connected spaces:\nLocal connectedness.\nA topological space is said to be locally connected at a point formula_17 if every neighbourhood of formula_17 contains a connected open neighbourhood. It is locally connected if it has a base of connected sets. It can be shown that a space formula_1 is locally connected if and only if every component of every open set of formula_1 is open.\nSimilarly, a topological space is said to be &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;locally path-connected if it has a base of path-connected sets.\nAn open subset of a locally path-connected space is connected if and only if it is path-connected.\nThis generalizes the earlier statement about formula_65 and formula_107, each of which is locally path-connected. More generally, any topological manifold is locally path-connected.\nLocally connected does not imply connected, nor does locally path-connected imply path connected. A simple example of a locally connected (and locally path-connected) space that is not connected (or path-connected) is the union of two separated intervals in formula_67, such as formula_128.\nA classical example of a connected space that is not locally connected is the so called topologist's sine curve, defined as formula_129, with the Euclidean topology induced by inclusion in formula_130.\nSet operations.\nThe intersection of connected sets is not necessarily connected.\nThe union of connected sets is not necessarily connected, as can be seen by considering formula_131.\nEach ellipse is a connected set, but the union is not connected, since it can be partitioned to two disjoint open sets formula_49 and formula_51.\nThis means that, if the union formula_1 is disconnected, then the collection formula_135 can be partitioned to two sub-collections, such that the unions of the sub-collections are disjoint and open in formula_1 (see picture). This implies that in several cases, a union of connected sets is necessarily connected. In particular:\nThe set difference of connected sets is not necessarily connected. However, if formula_144 and their difference formula_145 is disconnected (and thus can be written as a union of two open sets formula_146 and formula_147), then the union of formula_148 with each such component is connected (i.e. formula_149 is connected for all formula_150).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Proof\nBy contradiction, suppose formula_151 is not connected. So it can be written as the union of two disjoint open sets, e.g. formula_152. Because formula_148 is connected, it must be entirely contained in one of these components, say formula_154, and thus formula_155 is contained in formula_146. Now we know that:\nformula_157\nThe two sets in the last union are disjoint and open in formula_1, so there is a separation of formula_1, contradicting the fact that formula_1 is connected.\nGraphs.\nGraphs have path connected subsets, namely those subsets for which every pair of points has a path of edges joining them.\nBut it is not always possible to find a topology on the set of points which induces the same connected sets. The 5-cycle graph (and any formula_3-cycle with formula_167 odd) is one such example.\nAs a consequence, a notion of connectedness can be formulated independently of the topology on a space. To wit, there is a category of connective spaces consisting of sets with collections of connected subsets satisfying connectivity axioms; their morphisms are those functions which map connected sets to connected sets . Topological spaces and graphs are special cases of connective spaces; indeed, the finite connective spaces are precisely the finite graphs.\nHowever, every graph can be canonically made into a topological space, by treating vertices as points and edges as copies of the unit interval (see topological graph theory#Graphs as topological spaces). Then one can show that the graph is connected (in the graph theoretical sense) if and only if it is connected as a topological space.\nStronger forms of connectedness.\nThere are stronger forms of connectedness for topological spaces, for instance: \nIn general, any path connected space must be connected but there exist connected spaces that are not path connected. The deleted comb space furnishes such an example, as does the above-mentioned topologist's sine curve.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6235", "revid": "3519991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6235", "title": "Cell nucleus", "text": "Eukaryotic membrane-bounded organelle containing DNA\nThe cell nucleus (from la \" or\"\u00a0'kernel, seed'; plural form\u00a0nuclei) is a membrane-bound organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian red blood cells, have no nuclei, and a few others including osteoclasts have many. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm; and the nuclear matrix, a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support.\nThe cell nucleus contains nearly all of the cell's genome. Nuclear DNA is often organized into multiple chromosomes \u2013 long stands of DNA dotted with various proteins, such as histones, that protect and organize the DNA. The genes within these chromosomes are structured in such a way to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression.\nBecause the nuclear envelope is impermeable to large molecules, nuclear pores are required to regulate nuclear transport of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and RNA through the pores is required for both gene expression and the maintenance of chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound subcompartments, a number of nuclear bodies exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the nucleolus, involved in the assembly of ribosomes.\nStructures.\nThe nucleus contains nearly all of the cell's DNA, surrounded by a network of fibrous intermediate filaments and enveloped in a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope separates the fluid inside the nucleus, called the nucleoplasm, from the rest of the cell. The size of the nucleus is correlated to the size of the cell, and this ratio is reported across a range of cell types and species. In eukaryotes the nucleus in many cells typically occupies 10% of the cell volume. The nucleus is the largest organelle in animal cells. In human cells, the diameter of the nucleus is approximately six micrometres (\u00b5m).\nNuclear envelope and pores.\nThe nuclear envelope consists of two membranes, an inner and an outer nuclear membrane, perforated by nuclear pores. Together, these membranes serve to separate the cell's genetic material from the rest of the cell contents, and allow the nucleus to maintain an environment distinct from the rest of the cell. Despite their close apposition around much of the nucleus, the two membranes differ substantially in shape and contents. The inner membrane surrounds the nuclear content, providing its defining edge. Embedded within the inner membrane, various proteins bind the intermediate filaments that give the nucleus its structure. The outer membrane encloses the inner membrane, and is continuous with the adjacent endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As part of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the outer nuclear membrane is studded with ribosomes that are actively translating proteins across membrane. The space between the two membranes is called the perinuclear space, and is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.\nIn a mammalian nuclear envelope there are between 3000 and 4000 nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) perforating the envelope. Each NPC contains an eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. The number of NPCs can vary considerably across cell types; small glial cells only have about a few hundred, with large Purkinje cells having around 20,000. The NPC provides selective transport of molecules between the nucleoplasm and the cytosol. The nuclear pore complex is composed of approximately thirty different proteins known as nucleoporins. The pores are about 60\u201380 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 (in yeast) to several hundred proteins (in vertebrates). The pores are 100\u00a0nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9\u00a0nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. Attached to the ring is a structure called the \"nuclear basket\" that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.\nMost proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some RNAs are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins. Steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, as well as other small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling, can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand; in the absence of a ligand, many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression.\nNuclear lamina.\nIn animal cells, two networks of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores.\nThe nuclear lamina is composed mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported to the nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the \"nucleoplasmic veil\", that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase. Lamin structures that make up the veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.\nLike the components of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a \"protofilament\". Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike \"filament\". These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.\nMutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly cause a group of rare genetic disorders known as \"laminopathies\". The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of premature aging in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not well understood.\nChromosomes.\nThe cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.\nThere are two types of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and contains genes that are frequently expressed by the cell. The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that is infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into \"facultative\" heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and \"constitutive\" heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres. During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches, called \"chromosome territories\". Active genes, which are generally found in the euchromatic region of the chromosome, tend to be located towards the chromosome's territory boundary.\nAntibodies to certain types of chromatin organization, in particular, nucleosomes, have been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction.\nNucleolus.\nThe nucleolus is the largest of the discrete densely stained, membraneless structures known as nuclear bodies found in the nucleus. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.\nIn the first step of ribosome assembly, a protein called RNA polymerase I transcribes rDNA, which forms a large pre-rRNA precursor. This is cleaved into two large rRNA subunits \u2013 5.8S, and 28S, and a small rRNA subunit 18S. The transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and assembly of rRNA occurs in the nucleolus, aided by small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) molecules, some of which are derived from spliced introns from messenger RNAs encoding genes related to ribosomal function. The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear pores.\nWhen observed under the electron microscope, the nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost \"fibrillar centers\" (FCs), surrounded by the \"dense fibrillar component\" (DFC) (that contains fibrillarin and nucleolin), which in turn is bordered by the \"granular component\" (GC) (that contains the protein nucleophosmin). Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.\nOther nuclear bodies.\nBesides the nucleolus, the nucleus contains a number of other nuclear bodies. These include Cajal bodies, gemini of Cajal bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, paraspeckles, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.\nOther subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods has been reported in some cases of nemaline myopathy. This condition typically results from mutations in actin, and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins.\nCajal bodies and gems.\nA nucleus typically contains between one and ten compact structures called Cajal bodies or coiled bodies (CB), whose diameter measures between 0.2\u00a0\u00b5m and 2.0\u00a0\u00b5m depending on the cell type and species. When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin. CBs are involved in a number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation, and histone mRNA modification.\nSimilar to Cajal bodies are Gemini of Cajal bodies, or gems, whose name is derived from the Gemini constellation in reference to their close \"twin\" relationship with CBs. Gems are similar in size and shape to CBs, and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), but do contain a protein called survival of motor neuron (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, though it has also been suggested from microscopy evidence that CBs and gems are different manifestations of the same structure. Later ultrastructural studies have shown gems to be twins of Cajal bodies with the difference being in the coilin component; Cajal bodies are SMN positive and coilin positive, and gems are SMN positive and coilin negative.\nPIKA and PTF domains.\nPIKA domains, or polymorphic interphase karyosomal associations, were first described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function remains unclear, though they were not thought to be associated with active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing. They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA).\nPML-nuclear bodies.\nPromyelocytic leukemia protein (PML-nuclear bodies) are spherical bodies found scattered throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.1\u20131.0\u00a0\u00b5m. They are known by a number of other names, including nuclear domain 10 (ND10), Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. PML-nuclear bodies are named after one of their major components, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. Pml-/- mice, which are unable to create PML-nuclear bodies, develop normally without obvious ill effects, showing that PML-nuclear bodies are not required for most essential biological processes.\nSplicing speckles.\nSpeckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and are located in the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells.\nAt the fluorescence-microscope level they appear as irregular, punctate structures, which vary in size and shape, and when examined by electron microscopy they are seen as clusters of interchromatin granules. Speckles are dynamic structures, and both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations, including active transcription sites. Speckles can work with p53 as enhancers of gene activity to directly enhance the activity of certain genes. Moreover, speckle-associating and non-associating p53 gene targets are functionally distinct.\nStudies on the composition, structure and behaviour of speckles have provided a model for understanding the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus and the organization of the gene-expression machinery splicing snRNPs and other splicing proteins necessary for pre-mRNA processing. Because of a cell's changing requirements, the composition and location of these bodies changes according to mRNA transcription and regulation via phosphorylation of specific proteins. The splicing speckles are also known as nuclear speckles (nuclear specks), splicing factor compartments (SF compartments), interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), and B snurposomes.\nB snurposomes are found in the amphibian oocyte nuclei and in \"Drosophila melanogaster\" embryos. B snurposomes appear alone or attached to the Cajal bodies in the electron micrographs of the amphibian nuclei. IGCs function as storage sites for the splicing factors.\nParaspeckles.\nDiscovered by Fox et al. in 2002, paraspeckles are irregularly shaped compartments in the interchromatin space of the nucleus. First documented in HeLa cells, where there are generally 10\u201330 per nucleus, paraspeckles are now known to also exist in all human primary cells, transformed cell lines, and tissue sections. Their name is derived from their distribution in the nucleus; the \"para\" is short for parallel and the \"speckles\" refers to the splicing speckles to which they are always in close proximity.\nParaspeckles sequester nuclear proteins and RNA and thus appear to function as a molecular sponge that is involved in the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity. They are transcription dependent and in the absence of RNA Pol II transcription, the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated protein components (PSP1, p54nrb, PSP2, CFI(m)68, and PSF) form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the nucleolus. This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle. In the cell cycle, paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase. During telophase, when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no RNA Pol II transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap.\nPerichromatin fibrils.\nPerichromatin fibrils are visible only under electron microscope. They are located next to the transcriptionally active chromatin and are hypothesized to be the sites of active pre-mRNA processing.\nClastosomes.\nClastosomes are small nuclear bodies (0.2\u20130.5\u00a0\u00b5m) described as having a thick ring-shape due to the peripheral capsule around these bodies. This name is derived from the Greek \"klastos\", broken and \"soma\", body. Clastosomes are not typically present in normal cells, making them hard to detect. They form under high proteolytic conditions within the nucleus and degrade once there is a decrease in activity or if cells are treated with proteasome inhibitors. The scarcity of clastosomes in cells indicates that they are not required for proteasome function. Osmotic stress has also been shown to cause the formation of clastosomes. These nuclear bodies contain catalytic and regulatory subunits of the proteasome and its substrates, indicating that clastosomes are sites for degrading proteins.\nFunction.\nThe nucleus provides a site for genetic transcription that is segregated from the location of translation in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of gene regulation that are not available to prokaryotes. The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle.\nCell compartmentalization.\nThe nuclear envelope allows control of the nuclear contents, and separates them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane: In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.\nIn order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of NF-\u03baB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-\u03b1, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-\u03baB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.\nThe compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins.\nReplication.\nThe main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle. It has been found that replication happens in a localised way in the cell nucleus. In the S phase of interphase of the cell cycle; replication takes place. Contrary to the traditional view of moving replication forks along stagnant DNA, a concept of \"replication factories\" emerged, which means replication forks are concentrated towards some immobilised 'factory' regions through which the template DNA strands pass like conveyor belts.\nGene expression.\nGene expression first involves transcription, in which DNA is used as a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA (mRNA), which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported.\nSince the nucleus is the site of transcription, it also contains a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include helicases, which unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerases, which bind to the DNA promoter to synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerases, which change the amount of supercoiling in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of transcription factors that regulate expression.\nProcessing of pre-mRNA.\nNewly synthesized mRNA molecules are known as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation. The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete.\nRNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the spliceosome, is the process by which introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.\nDynamics and regulation.\nNuclear transport.\nThe entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes. Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation, macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit. \"Cargo\" proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals, which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins. The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by GTPases, enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is Ran, which is bound to either GTP or GDP (guanosine diphosphate), depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.\nNuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.\nSpecialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' central role in protein translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.\nAssembly and disassembly.\nDuring its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed, either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis (the process of programmed cell death). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus\u00a0\u2014 the envelope and lamina\u00a0\u2014 can be systematically degraded.\nIn most cells, the disassembly of the nuclear envelope marks the end of the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.\nAt a certain point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.\nHowever, in dinoflagellates, the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliates, sporozoans) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.\nApoptosis is a controlled process in which the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.\nThe nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.\nDisease-related dynamics.\nInitially, it has been suspected that immunoglobulins in general and autoantibodies in particular do not enter the nucleus. Now there is a body of evidence that under pathological conditions (e.g. lupus erythematosus) IgG can enter the nucleus.\nNuclei per cell.\nMost eukaryotic cell types usually have a single nucleus, but some have no nuclei, while others have several. This can result from normal development, as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells, or from faulty cell division.\nAnucleated cells.\nAn anucleated cell contains no nucleus and is, therefore, incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells. The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or erythrocyte, which also lacks other organelles such as mitochondria, and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes. The nucleus is expelled during the process of differentiation from an erythroblast to a reticulocyte, which is the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte. The presence of mutagens may induce the release of some immature \"micronucleated\" erythrocytes into the bloodstream. Anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other has two nuclei.\nIn flowering plants, this condition occurs in sieve tube elements.\nMultinucleated cells.\nMultinucleated cells contain multiple nuclei. Most acantharean species of protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cells. Other examples include the intestinal parasites in the genus \"Giardia\", which have two nuclei per cell. Ciliates have two kinds of nuclei in a single cell, a somatic macronucleus and a germline micronucleus. In humans, skeletal muscle cells, also called myocytes and syncytium, become multinucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near the periphery of the cells allows maximal intracellular space for myofibrils. Other multinucleate cells in the human are osteoclasts a type of bone cell. Multinucleated and binucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation.\nA number of dinoflagellates are known to have two nuclei. Unlike other multinucleated cells these nuclei contain two distinct lineages of DNA: one from the dinoflagellate and the other from a symbiotic diatom.\nEvolution.\nAs the major defining characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus's evolutionary origin has been the subject of much speculation. Four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support.\nThe first model known as the \"syntrophic model\" proposes that a symbiotic relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell. (Organisms of the Archaea and Bacteria domain have no cell nucleus.) It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern methanogenic archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria, eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria. One possibility is that the nuclear membrane arose as a new membrane system following the origin of mitochondria in an archaebacterial host. The nuclear membrane may have served to protect the genome from damaging reactive oxygen species produced by the protomitochondria. The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins, including histones. Observations that myxobacteria are motile, can form multicellular complexes, and possess kinases and G proteins similar to eukarya, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell.\nA second model proposes that proto-eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage. This model is based on the existence of modern Planctomycetota bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures. A similar proposal states that a eukaryote-like cell, the , evolved first and phagocytosed archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell.\nThe most controversial model, known as \"viral eukaryogenesis\", posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, along with other eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins (analogizing histones to viral envelopes). One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular \"predator\". Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses, on the basis of observed similarity between the DNA polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes. It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis.\nA more recent proposal, the \"exomembrane hypothesis\", suggests that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits.\nHistory.\nThe nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. What is most likely the oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632\u20131723). He observed a \"lumen\", the nucleus, in the red blood cells of salmon. Unlike mammalian red blood cells, those of other vertebrates still contain nuclei.\nThe nucleus was also described by Franz Bauer in 1804 and in more detail in 1831 by Scottish botanist Robert Brown in a talk at the Linnean Society of London. Brown was studying orchids under the microscope when he observed an opaque area, which he called the \"areola\" or \"nucleus\", in the cells of the flower's outer layer. He did not suggest a potential function. \nIn 1838, Matthias Schleiden proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name \"cytoblast\" (\"cell builder\"). He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around \"cytoblasts\". Franz Meyen was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the \"cytoblast\" or otherwise, contradicted work by Robert Remak (1852) and Rudolf Virchow (1855) who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells (\"\"). The function of the nucleus remained unclear.\nBetween 1877 and 1878, Oscar Hertwig published several studies on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs, showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a (single) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a \"monerula\", a structureless mass of primordial protoplasm (\"Urschleim\"). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, including amphibians and molluscs. Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants in 1884. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ \"cells\" for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA review article about nuclear lamins, explaining their structure and various roles\nA review article about nuclear transport, explains the principles of the mechanism, and the various transport pathways\nA review article about the nucleus, explaining the structure of chromosomes within the organelle, and describing the nucleolus and other subnuclear bodies\nA review article about the evolution of the nucleus, explaining a number of different theories\nA university level textbook focusing on cell biology.

{"id": "6237", "revid": "294421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6237", "title": "Christmas", "text": "Holiday originating in Christianity, usually December 25\nChristmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday season organized around it.\nThe traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread the word.\nThere are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus' birth and in the early fourth century, the church fixed the date as December 25. This corresponds to the traditional date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar. It is exactly nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the date of the spring equinox. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than knowing Jesus' exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.\nThe celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music and caroling; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; church services; a special meal; and the display of various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing economic effect in many regions of the world.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"Christmas\" is a shortened form of \"Christ's Mass\". The word is recorded as \"Cr\u012bstesm\u00e6sse\" in 1038 and \"Cristes-messe\" in 1131. \"Cr\u012bst\" (genitive \"Cr\u012bstes\") is from Greek \"Khr\u012bstos\" (\u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2), a translation of Hebrew \"M\u0101\u0161\u00eea\u1e25\" (\u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7), \"Messiah\", meaning \"anointed\"; and \"m\u00e6sse\" is from Latin \"missa\", the celebration of the Eucharist.\nThe form \"Christenmas\" was also used during some periods, but is now considered archaic and dialectal. The term derives from Middle English \"Cristenmasse\", meaning \"Christian mass\". \"Xmas\" is an abbreviation of \"Christmas\" found particularly in print, based on the initial letter chi (\u03a7) in Greek \"Khr\u012bstos\" (\u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2) (\"Christ\"), although some style guides discourage its use. This abbreviation has precedent in Middle English \"\u03a7\u03c1\u0304es masse\" (where \"\u03a7\u03c1\u0304\" is an abbreviation for \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2).\nOther names.\nIn addition to \"Christmas\", the holiday has had various other English names throughout its history. The Anglo-Saxons referred to the feast as \"midwinter\", or, more rarely, as \"N\u0101tiuite\u00f0\" (from Latin \"n\u0101t\u012bvit\u0101s\" below). \"Nativity\", meaning \"birth\", is from Latin \"n\u0101t\u012bvit\u0101s\". In Old English, \"G\u0113ola\" (\"Yule\") referred to the period corresponding to December and January, which was eventually equated with Christian Christmas. \"Noel\" (also \"Nowel\" or \"Nowell\", as in \"The First Nowell\") entered English in the late 14th century and is from the Old French \"no\u00ebl\" or \"na\u00ebl\", itself ultimately from the Latin \"n\u0101t\u0101lis (di\u0113s)\" meaning \"birth (day)\".\nKoleda is the traditional Slavic name for Christmas and the period from Christmas to Epiphany or, more generally, to Slavic Christmas-related rituals, some dating to pre-Christian times.\nNativity.\nThe gospels of Luke and Matthew describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem to the Virgin Mary. In the gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem for the census, and Jesus was born there and placed in a manger. Angels proclaimed him a savior for all people, and shepherds came to adore him. The gospel of Matthew adds that the magi followed a star to Bethlehem to bring gifts to Jesus, born the king of the Jews. King Herod ordered the massacre of all the boys less than two years old in Bethlehem, but the family fled to Egypt and later returned to Nazareth.\nHistory.\nThe nativity sequences included in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke prompted early Christian writers to suggest various dates for the anniversary.\nAt the time of the 2nd century, the \"earliest church records\" indicate that \"Christians were remembering and celebrating the birth of the Lord\", an \"observance [that] sprang up organically from the authentic devotion of ordinary believers.\" Though Christmas did not appear on the lists of festivals given by the early Christian writers Irenaeus and Tertullian, the Chronograph of 354 records that a Christmas celebration took place in Rome eight days before the calends of January. This section was written in AD 336, during the brief pontificate of Pope Mark.\nIn the East, the birth of Jesus was celebrated in connection with the Epiphany on January 6. This holiday was not primarily about the nativity, but rather the baptism of Jesus. Christmas was promoted in the East as part of the revival of Orthodox Christianity that followed the death of the pro-Arian Emperor Valens at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. The feast was introduced in Constantinople in 379, in Antioch by John Chrysostom towards the end of the fourth century, probably in 388, and in Alexandria in the following century. The presence of hymns for the feast in the Georgian Iadgari demonstrates that it was celebrated in Jerusalem by the 6th century at the latest.\nThe first recorded Christmas celebration was in Rome on December 25, AD 336. In the 3rd century, the date of the nativity was the subject of great interest. Around AD 200, Clement of Alexandria wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There are those who have determined not only the year of our Lord's birth, but also the day; and they say that it took place in the 28th year of Augustus, and in the 25th day of [the Egyptian month] Pachon [May 20] ... Further, others say that He was born on the 24th or 25th of Pharmuthi [April 20 or 21]. Various factors contributed to the selection of December 25 as a date of celebration: it was nine months after the date linked to the conception of Jesus\u2014March 25, which also marked the vernal equinox (celebrated as the Feast of the Annunciation) and it was the date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar. Adam C. English, Professor of Religion at Campbell University, writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;First, we should examine the biblical evidence regarding \"the timing of the conception\". \u2026 The angel Gabriel appeared to Zechariah, husband of Elizabeth and father of John the Baptizer, on the day he was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary of the Lord and offer incense (Luke 1:9) Zechariah belonged to the tribe of Levi, the one tribe especially selected by the Lord to serve as priests. Not restricted to any one tribal territory, the Levite priests dispersed throughout the land of Israel. Nevertheless, many chose to live near Jerusalem in order to fulfill duties in the Temple, just like Zechariah who resided at nearby Ein Karem. Lots were cast regularly to decide any number of priestly duties: preparing the altar, making the sacrifice, cleaning the ashes, burning the morning or evening incense. Yet, given the drama of the event, it would seem that he entered the Temple sanctuary on the highest and holiest day of the year, the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur. There, beside the altar of the Lord, a radiant angel gave news of the child to be born to Elizabeth. The date reckoned for this occurrence is September 24, based on computations from the Jewish calendar in accordance with Leviticus 23 regarding the Day of Atonement. According to Luke 1:26, Gabriel's annunciation to Mary took place in the \"sixth month\" of Elizabeth's pregnancy. That is, Mary conceives six months after Elizabeth. Luke repeats the uniqueness of the timing in verse 36. Counting six months from September 24 we arrive at March 25, the most likely date for the annunciation and conception of Mary. Nine months hence takes us to December 25, which turns out to be a surprisingly reasonable date for the birthday. \u2026 In Palestine, the months of November mark the rainy season, the only time of the year sheep might find fresh green grass to graze. During the other ten months of the year, animals must content themselves on dry straw. So, the suggestion that shepherds might have stayed out in the fields with their flocks in late December, at the peak of the rainy season, is not only reasonable, it is most certain.\nThe early Church Fathers John Chrysostom, Augustine of Hippo, and Jerome attested to 25 December as the date of Christmas. The primitive Church connected Jesus to the Sun through the use of such phrases as \"Sun of righteousness.\" The early Christian writer Lactantius wrote \"the east is attached to God because he is the source of light and the illuminator of the world and he makes us rise toward eternal life.\" It is for this reason that the early Christians established the direction of prayer as being eastward, towards the rising sun. In the Roman Empire, in which many Christians resided, the winter solstice was marked on December 25.\nIn 567, the Council of Tours put in place the season of Christmastide, proclaiming \"the twelve days from Christmas to Epiphany as a sacred and festive season, and established the duty of Advent fasting in preparation for the feast.\" This was done in order to solve the \"administrative problem for the Roman Empire as it tried to coordinate the solar Julian calendar with the lunar calendars of its provinces in the east.\"\nChristmas played a role in the Arian controversy of the fourth century. After this controversy ran its course, the prominence of the holiday declined for a few centuries. The feast regained prominence after 800 when Charlemagne was crowned emperor on Christmas Day.\nIn Puritan England, Christmas was banned, with Puritans considering it a Catholic invention and also associating the day with drunkenness and other misbehaviour. It was restored as a legal holiday in England in 1660 when Puritan legislation was declared null and void, but it remained disreputable in the minds of some. In the early 19th century, Christmas festivities and services became widespread with the rise of the Oxford Movement in the Church of England that emphasized the centrality of Christmas in Christianity and charity to the poor, along with Washington Irving, Charles Dickens, and other authors emphasizing family, children, kind-heartedness, gift-giving, and Santa Claus (for Irving), or Father Christmas (for Dickens).\nVarious theories have been offered with respect to the establishment of the dates on which the Christian Churches came to celebrate Christmas:\nCalculation hypothesis.\nThe calculation hypothesis suggests that an earlier holiday, the Annunciation (which celebrated the conception of Jesus), held on March 25 became associated with the Incarnation. Christmas was then calculated as nine months later. The calculation hypothesis was proposed by French writer Louis Duchesne in 1889. The Bible in records the annunciation to Mary to be at the time when Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist, was in her sixth month of pregnancy (cf. \"Nativity of Saint John the Baptist\"). Thus, the ecclesiastical holiday to commemorate the Annunciation of the Lord was created in the seventh century and was assigned to be celebrated on March 25; this date is nine months before Christmas, in addition to being the traditional date of the equinox. It is unrelated to the Quartodeciman, which had been forgotten by this time.\nEarly Christians celebrated the life of Jesus on a date considered equivalent to 14 Nisan (Passover) on the local calendar. Because Passover was held on the 14th of the month, this feast is referred to as the Quartodeciman. All the major events of Christ's life, especially the passion, were celebrated on this date. In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul mentions Passover, presumably celebrated according to the local calendar in Corinth. Tertullian (d. 220), who lived in Latin-speaking North Africa, gives the date of passion celebration as March 25. The date of the passion was moved to Good Friday in 165. According to the calculation hypothesis, the celebration of the Quartodeciman continued in some areas and the feast became associated with Incarnation.\nThe calculation hypothesis is considered academically to be \"a thoroughly viable hypothesis\", though not certain. It was a traditional Jewish belief that great men were born and died on the same day, so lived a whole number of years, without fractions: Jesus was therefore considered to have been conceived on March 25, as he died on March 25, which was calculated to have coincided with 14\u00a0Nisan. A passage in \"Commentary on the Prophet Daniel\" (204) by Hippolytus of Rome identifies December 25 as the date of the nativity. This passage is generally considered a late interpolation. But the manuscript includes another passage, one that is more likely to be authentic, that gives the passion as March 25.\nIn 221, Sextus Julius Africanus (c.\u00a0160 \u2013 c.\u00a0240) gave March 25 as the day of creation and of the conception of Jesus in his universal history. This conclusion was based on solar symbolism, with March 25 the date of the equinox. As this implies a birth in December, it is sometimes claimed to be the earliest identification of December 25 as the nativity. However, Africanus was not such an influential writer that it is likely he determined the date of Christmas.\nThe treatise \"De solstitia et aequinoctia conceptionis et nativitatis Domini nostri Iesu Christi et Iohannis Baptistae,\" pseudepigraphically attributed to John Chrysostom and dating to the early fourth century, also argued that Jesus was conceived and crucified on the same day of the year and calculated this as March 25. This anonymous tract also states: \"But Our Lord, too, is born in the month of December\u00a0... the eight before the calends of January [25 December]\u00a0..., But they call it the 'Birthday of the Unconquered'. Who indeed is so unconquered as Our Lord...? Or, if they say that it is the birthday of the Sun, He is the Sun of Justice.\"\nSolstice date hypothesis.\nDecember 25 was considered the date of the winter solstice in the Roman calendar, though actually it occurred on the 23rd or 24th at that time. A late fourth-century sermon by Saint Augustine explains why this was a fitting day to celebrate Christ's nativity: \"Hence it is that He was born on the day which is the shortest in our earthly reckoning and from which subsequent days begin to increase in length. He, therefore, who bent low and lifted us up chose the shortest day, yet the one whence light begins to increase.\"\nLinking Jesus to the Sun was supported by various Biblical passages. Jesus was considered to be the \"Sun of righteousness\" prophesied by Malachi: \"Unto you shall the sun of righteousness arise, and healing is in his wings.\"\nSuch solar symbolism could support more than one date of birth. An anonymous work known as \"De Pascha Computus\" (243) linked the idea that creation began at the spring equinox, on March 25, with the conception or birth (the word \"nascor\" can mean either) of Jesus on March 28, the day of the creation of the sun in the Genesis account. One translation reads: \"O the splendid and divine providence of the Lord, that on that day, the very day, on which the sun was made, March 28, a Wednesday, Christ should be born\".\nIn the 17th century, Isaac Newton, who, coincidentally, was born on December 25, argued that the date of Christmas may have been selected to correspond with the solstice.\nConversely, according to Steven Hijmans of the University of Alberta, \"It is cosmic symbolism ... which inspired the Church leadership in Rome to elect the southern solstice, December 25, as the birthday of Christ, and the northern solstice as that of John the Baptist, supplemented by the equinoxes as their respective dates of conception.\"\nHistory of religions hypothesis.\nThe rival \"History of Religions\" hypothesis suggests that the Church selected December 25 date to appropriate festivities held by the Romans in honor of the Sun god Sol Invictus. This cult was established by Aurelian in 274. An explicit expression of this theory appears in an annotation of uncertain date added to a manuscript of a work by 12th-century Syrian bishop Jacob Bar-Salibi. The scribe who added it wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was a custom of the Pagans to celebrate on the same 25\u00a0December the birthday of the Sun, at which they kindled lights in token of festivity. In these solemnities and revelries, the Christians also took part. Accordingly, when the doctors of the Church perceived that the Christians had a leaning to this festival, they took counsel and resolved that the true Nativity should be solemnised on that day.\nIn 1743, German Protestant Paul Ernst Jablonski argued Christmas was placed on December 25 to correspond with the Roman solar holiday \"Dies Natalis Solis Invicti\" and was therefore a \"paganization\" that debased the true church. However, it has been also argued that, on the contrary, the Emperor Aurelian, who in 274 instituted the holiday of the \"Dies Natalis Solis Invicti\", did so partly as an attempt to give a pagan significance to a date already important for Christians in Rome.\nHermann Usener and others proposed that the Christians chose this day because it was the Roman feast celebrating the birthday of Sol Invictus. Modern scholar S. E. Hijmans, however, states that \"While they were aware that pagans called this day the 'birthday' of Sol Invictus, this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for Christmas.\" Moreover, Thomas J. Talley holds that the Roman Emperor Aurelian placed a festival of Sol Invictus on December 25 in order to compete with the growing rate of the Christian Church, which had already been celebrating Christmas on that date first. In the judgement of the Church of England Liturgical Commission, the History of Religions hypothesis has been challenged by a view based on an old tradition, according to which the date of Christmas was fixed at nine months after March 25, the date of the vernal equinox, on which the Annunciation was celebrated. Adam C. English, Professor of Religion at Campbell University, writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWith regard to a December religious feast of the deified Sun (Sol), as distinct from a solstice feast of the birth (or rebirth) of the astronomical sun, Hijmans has commented that \"while the winter solstice on or around December 25 was well established in the Roman imperial calendar, there is no evidence that a religious celebration of Sol on that day antedated the celebration of Christmas\". \"Thomas Talley has shown that, although the Emperor Aurelian's dedication of a temple to the sun god in the Campus Martius (C.E. 274) probably took place on the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' on December 25, the cult of the sun in pagan Rome ironically did not celebrate the winter solstice nor any of the other quarter-tense days, as one might expect.\" The \"Oxford Companion to Christian Thought\" remarks on the uncertainty about the order of precedence between the religious celebrations of the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun and of the birthday of Jesus, stating that the hypothesis that December 25 was chosen for celebrating the birth of Jesus on the basis of the belief that his conception occurred on March 25 \"potentially establishes 25 December as a Christian festival before Aurelian's decree, which, when promulgated, might have provided for the Christian feast both opportunity and challenge\".\nRelation to concurrent celebrations.\nMany popular customs associated with Christmas developed independently of the commemoration of Jesus' birth, with some claiming that certain elements are Christianized and have origins in pre-Christian festivals that were celebrated by pagan populations who were later converted to Christianity; other scholars reject these claims and affirm that Christmas customs largely developed in a Christian context. The prevailing atmosphere of Christmas has also continually evolved since the holiday's inception, ranging from a sometimes raucous, drunken, carnival-like state in the Middle Ages, to a tamer family-oriented and children-centered theme introduced in a 19th-century transformation. The celebration of Christmas was banned on more than one occasion within certain groups, such as the Puritans and Jehovah's Witnesses (who do not celebrate birthdays in general), due to concerns that it was too unbiblical.\nPrior to and through the early Christian centuries, winter festivals were the most popular of the year in many European pagan cultures. Reasons included the fact that less agricultural work needed to be done during the winter, as well as an expectation of better weather as spring approached. Celtic winter herbs such as mistletoe and ivy, and the custom of kissing under a mistletoe, are common in modern Christmas celebrations in the English-speaking countries.\nThe pre-Christian Germanic peoples\u2014including the Anglo-Saxons and the Norse\u2014celebrated a winter festival called Yule, held in the late December to early January period, yielding modern English \"yule\", today used as a synonym for \"Christmas\". In Germanic language-speaking areas, numerous elements of modern Christmas folk custom and iconography may have originated from Yule, including the Yule log, Yule boar, and the Yule goat. Often leading a ghostly procession through the sky (the Wild Hunt), the long-bearded god Odin is referred to as \"the Yule one\" and \"Yule father\" in Old Norse texts, while other gods are referred to as \"Yule beings\". On the other hand, as there are no reliable existing references to a Christmas log prior to the 16th century, the burning of the Christmas block may have been an early modern invention by Christians unrelated to the pagan practice.\nIn eastern Europe also, pre-Christian traditions were incorporated into Christmas celebrations there, an example being the Koleda, which shares parallels with the Christmas carol.\nPost-classical history.\nIn the Early Middle Ages, Christmas Day was overshadowed by Epiphany, which in western Christianity focused on the visit of the magi. But the medieval calendar was dominated by Christmas-related holidays. The forty days before Christmas became the \"forty days of St. Martin\" (which began on November 11, the feast of St. Martin of Tours), now known as Advent. In Italy, former Saturnalian traditions were attached to Advent. Around the 12th century, these traditions transferred again to the Twelve Days of Christmas (December 25 \u2013 January 5); a time that appears in the liturgical calendars as Christmastide or Twelve Holy Days.\nThe prominence of Christmas Day increased gradually after Charlemagne was crowned Emperor on Christmas Day in 800. King Edmund the Martyr was anointed on Christmas in 855 and King William I of England was crowned on Christmas Day 1066.\nBy the High Middle Ages, the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where various magnates celebrated Christmas. King Richard II of England hosted a Christmas feast in 1377 at which 28 oxen and 300 sheep were eaten. The Yule boar was a common feature of medieval Christmas feasts. Caroling also became popular, and was originally performed by a group of dancers who sang. The group was composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus. Various writers of the time condemned caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly traditions of Saturnalia and Yule may have continued in this form. \"Misrule\"\u2014drunkenness, promiscuity, gambling\u2014was also an important aspect of the festival. In England, gifts were exchanged on New Year's Day, and there was special Christmas ale.\nChristmas during the Middle Ages was a public festival that incorporated ivy, holly, and other evergreens. Christmas gift-giving during the Middle Ages was usually between people with legal relationships, such as tenant and landlord. The annual indulgence in eating, dancing, singing, sporting, and card playing escalated in England, and by the 17th century the Christmas season featured lavish dinners, elaborate masques, and pageants. In 1607, King James I insisted that a play be acted on Christmas night and that the court indulge in games. It was during the Reformation in 16th\u201317th-century Europe that many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or \"Christkindl\", and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.\nModern history.\n17th and 18th centuries.\nFollowing the Protestant Reformation, many of the new denominations, including the Anglican Church and Lutheran Church, continued to celebrate Christmas. In 1629, the Anglican poet John Milton penned \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\", a poem that has since been read by many during Christmastide. Donald Heinz, a professor at California State University, states that Martin Luther \"inaugurated a period in which Germany would produce a unique culture of Christmas, much copied in North America.\" Among the congregations of the Dutch Reformed Church, Christmas was celebrated as one of the principal evangelical feasts.\nHowever, in 17th century England, some groups such as the Puritans strongly condemned the celebration of Christmas, considering it a Catholic invention and the \"trappings of popery\" or the \"rags of the Beast\". In contrast, the established Anglican Church \"pressed for a more elaborate observance of feasts, penitential seasons, and saints' days. The calendar reform became a major point of tension between the Anglican party and the Puritan party.\" The Catholic Church also responded, promoting the festival in a more religiously oriented form. King Charles I of England directed his noblemen and gentry to return to their landed estates in midwinter to keep up their old-style Christmas generosity. Following the Parliamentarian victory over Charles I during the English Civil War, England's Puritan rulers banned Christmas in 1647.\nProtests followed as pro-Christmas rioting broke out in several cities and for weeks Canterbury was controlled by the rioters, who decorated doorways with holly and shouted royalist slogans. The book, \"The Vindication of Christmas\" (London, 1652), argued against the Puritans, and makes note of Old English Christmas traditions, dinner, roast apples on the fire, card playing, dances with \"plow-boys\" and \"maidservants\", old Father Christmas and carol singing. During the ban, semi-clandestine religious services marking Christ's birth continued to be held, and people sang carols in secret.\nThe Restoration of King Charles II in 1660 ended the ban, and Christmas was again freely celebrated in England. Many Calvinist clergymen disapproved of Christmas celebration. As such, in Scotland, the Presbyterian Church of Scotland discouraged the observance of Christmas, and though James VI commanded its celebration in 1618, attendance at church was scant. The Parliament of Scotland officially abolished the observance of Christmas in 1640, claiming that the church had been \"purged of all superstitious observation of days\". Whereas in England, Wales and Ireland Christmas Day is a common law holiday, having been a customary holiday since time immemorial, it was not until 1871 that it was designated a bank holiday in Scotland.\nFollowing the Restoration of Charles II, \"Poor Robin's Almanack\" contained the lines: \"Now thanks to God for Charles return, / Whose absence made old Christmas mourn. / For then we scarcely did it know, / Whether it Christmas were or no.\" The diary of James Woodforde, from the latter half of the 18th century, details the observance of Christmas and celebrations associated with the season over a number of years.\nAs in England, Puritans in Colonial America staunchly opposed the observation of Christmas. The Pilgrims of New England pointedly spent their first December 25 in the New World working normally. Puritans such as Cotton Mather condemned Christmas both because scripture did not mention its observance and because Christmas celebrations of the day often involved boisterous behavior. Many non-Puritans in New England deplored the loss of the holidays enjoyed by the laboring classes in England. Christmas observance was outlawed in Boston in 1659. The ban on Christmas observance was revoked in 1681 by English governor Edmund Andros, but it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became fashionable in the Boston region.\nAt the same time, Christian residents of Virginia and New York observed the holiday freely. Pennsylvania Dutch settlers, predominantly Moravian settlers of Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Lititz in Pennsylvania and the Wachovia settlements in North Carolina, were enthusiastic celebrators of Christmas. The Moravians in Bethlehem had the first Christmas trees in America as well as the first Nativity Scenes. Christmas fell out of favor in the United States after the American Revolution, when it was considered an English custom.\nGeorge Washington attacked Hessian (German) mercenaries on the day after Christmas during the Battle of Trenton on December 26, 1776, Christmas being much more popular in Germany than in America at this time.\nWith the atheistic Cult of Reason in power during the era of Revolutionary France, Christian Christmas religious services were banned and the three kings cake was renamed the \"equality cake\" under anticlerical government policies.\n19th century.\nIn the early-19th century, writers imagined Tudor Christmas as a time of heartfelt celebration. In 1843, Charles Dickens wrote the novel \"A Christmas Carol\", which helped revive the \"spirit\" of Christmas and seasonal merriment. Its instant popularity played a major role in portraying Christmas as a holiday emphasizing family, goodwill, and compassion.\nDickens sought to construct Christmas as a family-centered festival of generosity, linking \"worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation.\" Superimposing his humanitarian vision of the holiday, in what has been termed \"Carol Philosophy\", Dickens influenced many aspects of Christmas that are celebrated today in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games, and a festive generosity of spirit. A prominent phrase from the tale, \"Merry Christmas\", was popularized following the appearance of the story. This coincided with the appearance of the Oxford Movement and the growth of Anglo-Catholicism, which led a revival in traditional rituals and religious observances.\nThe term Scrooge became a synonym for miser, with \"Bah! Humbug!\" dismissive of the festive spirit. In 1843, the first commercial Christmas card was produced by Sir Henry Cole. The revival of the Christmas Carol began with William Sandys's \"Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern\" (1833), with the first appearance in print of \"The First Noel\", \"I Saw Three Ships\", \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\" and \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\", popularized in Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\".\nIn Britain, the Christmas tree was introduced in the early 19th century by the German-born Queen Charlotte. In 1832, the future Queen Victoria wrote about her delight at having a Christmas tree, hung with lights, ornaments, and presents placed round it. After her marriage to her German cousin Prince Albert, by 1841 the custom became more widespread throughout Britain.\nAn image of the British royal family with their Christmas tree at Windsor Castle created a sensation when it was published in the \"Illustrated London News\" in 1848. A modified version of this image was published in \"Godey's Lady's Book\", Philadelphia in 1850. By the 1870s, putting up a Christmas tree had become common in America.\nIn America, interest in Christmas had been revived in the 1820s by several short stories by Washington Irving which appear in his \"The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.\" and \"Old Christmas\". Irving's stories depicted harmonious warm-hearted English Christmas festivities he experienced while staying in Aston Hall, Birmingham, England, that had largely been abandoned, and he used the tract \"Vindication of Christmas\" (1652) of Old English Christmas traditions, that he had transcribed into his journal as a format for his stories.\nIn 1822, Clement Clarke Moore wrote the poem \"A Visit From St. Nicholas\" (popularly known by its first line: \"Twas the Night Before Christmas\").\nThe poem helped popularize the tradition of exchanging gifts, and seasonal Christmas shopping began to assume economic importance.\nThis also started the cultural conflict between the holiday's spiritual significance and its associated commercialism that some see as corrupting the holiday. In her 1850 book \"The First Christmas in New England\", Harriet Beecher Stowe includes a character who complains that the true meaning of Christmas was lost in a shopping spree.\nWhile the celebration of Christmas was not yet customary in some regions in the U.S., Henry Wadsworth Longfellow detected \"a transition state about Christmas here in New England\" in 1856. \"The old puritan feeling prevents it from being a cheerful, hearty holiday; though every year makes it more so.\"\nIn Reading, Pennsylvania, a newspaper remarked in 1861, \"Even our presbyterian friends who have hitherto steadfastly ignored Christmas\u2014threw open their church doors and assembled in force to celebrate the anniversary of the Savior's birth.\"\nThe First Congregational Church of Rockford, Illinois, \"although of genuine Puritan stock\", was 'preparing for a grand Christmas jubilee', a news correspondent reported in 1864. By 1860, fourteen states including several from New England had adopted Christmas as a legal holiday. In 1875, Louis Prang introduced the Christmas card to Americans. He has been called the \"father of the American Christmas card\". On June 28, 1870, Christmas was formally declared a United States federal holiday.\n20th century.\nDuring the First World War and particularly (but not exclusively) in 1914, a series of informal truces took place for Christmas between opposing armies. The truces, which were organised spontaneously by fighting men, ranged from promises not to shoot shouted at a distance in order to ease the pressure of war for the day to friendly socializing, gift giving and even sport between enemies. These incidents became a well known and semi-mythologised part of popular memory. They have been described as a symbol of common humanity even in the darkest of situations and used to demonstrate to children the ideals of Christmas.\nUp to the 1950s in the UK, many Christmas customs were restricted to the upper classes and better-off families. The mass of the population had not adopted many of the Christmas rituals that later became general. The Christmas tree was rare. Christmas dinner might be beef or goose \u2013 certainly not turkey. In their stockings children might get an apple, orange, and sweets. Full celebration of a family Christmas with all the trimmings only became widespread with increased prosperity from the 1950s. National papers were published on Christmas Day until 1912. Post was still delivered on Christmas Day until 1961. League football matches continued in Scotland until the 1970s while in England they ceased at the end of the 1950s.\nUnder the state atheism of the Soviet Union, after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations\u2014along with other Christian holidays\u2014were prohibited in public. During the 1920s, '30s, and '40s, the League of Militant Atheists encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, such as the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays, including Easter; the League established an antireligious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement. At the height of this persecution, in 1929, on Christmas Day, children in Moscow were encouraged to spit on crucifixes as a protest against the holiday. Instead, the importance of the holiday and all its trappings, such as the Christmas tree and gift-giving, was transferred to the New Year. It was not until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 that the persecution ended and Orthodox Christmas became a state holiday again for the first time in Russia after seven decades.\nEuropean History Professor Joseph Perry wrote that likewise, in Nazi Germany, \"because Nazi ideologues saw organized religion as an enemy of the totalitarian state, propagandists sought to deemphasize\u2014or eliminate altogether\u2014the Christian aspects of the holiday\" and that \"Propagandists tirelessly promoted numerous Nazified Christmas songs, which replaced Christian themes with the regime's racial ideologies.\"\nAs Christmas celebrations began to be held around the world even outside traditional Christian cultures in the 20th century, some Muslim-majority countries subsequently banned the practice of Christmas, claiming it undermines Islam.\nObservance and traditions.\nChristmas Day is celebrated as a major festival and public holiday in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-Christian. In some non-Christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration (e.g. Hong Kong); in others, Christian minorities or foreign cultural influences have led populations to observe the holiday. Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the cultural aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees. A similar example is in Turkey, being Muslim-majority and with a small number of Christians, where Christmas trees and decorations tend to line public streets during the festival.\nAmong countries with a strong Christian tradition, a variety of Christmas celebrations have developed that incorporate regional and local cultures.\nChurch attendance.\nChristmas Day (inclusive of its vigil, Christmas Eve), is a Festival in the Lutheran Churches, a solemnity in the Roman Catholic Church, and a Principal Feast of the Anglican Communion. Other Christian denominations do not rank their feast days but nevertheless place importance on Christmas Eve/Christmas Day, as with other Christian feasts like Easter, Ascension Day, and Pentecost. As such, for Christians, attending a Christmas Eve or Christmas Day church service plays an important part in the recognition of the Christmas season. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance. A 2010 survey by LifeWay Christian Resources found that six in ten Americans attend church services during this time. In the United Kingdom, the Church of England reported an estimated attendance of 2.5 million people at Christmas services in 2015.\nDecorations.\nNativity scenes are known from 10th-century Rome. They were popularised by Saint Francis of Assisi from 1223, quickly spreading across Europe. Different types of decorations developed across the Christian world, dependent on local tradition and available resources, and can vary from simple representations of the crib to far more elaborate sets \u2013 renowned manger scene traditions include the colourful \"Krak\u00f3w szopka\" in Poland, which imitate Krak\u00f3w's historical buildings as settings, the elaborate Italian \"presepi\" (, and ), or the Proven\u00e7al cr\u00e8ches in southern France, using hand-painted terracotta figurines called \"santons\". In certain parts of the world, notably Sicily, living nativity scenes following the tradition of Saint Francis are a popular alternative to static cr\u00e8ches. The first commercially produced decorations appeared in Germany in the 1860s, inspired by paper chains made by children. In countries where a representation of the Nativity scene is very popular, people are encouraged to compete and create the most original or realistic ones. Within some families, the pieces used to make the representation are considered a valuable family heirloom.\nThe traditional colors of Christmas decorations are red, green, and gold. Red symbolizes the blood of Jesus, which was shed in his crucifixion; green symbolizes eternal life, and in particular the evergreen tree, which does not lose its leaves in the winter; and gold is the first color associated with Christmas, as one of the three gifts of the Magi, symbolizing royalty.\nThe Christmas tree was first used by German Lutherans in the 16th century, with records indicating that a Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strassburg in 1539, under the leadership of the Protestant Reformer, Martin Bucer. In the United States, these \"German Lutherans brought the decorated Christmas tree with them; the Moravians put lighted candles on those trees.\" When decorating the Christmas tree, many individuals place a star at the top of the tree symbolizing the Star of Bethlehem, a fact recorded by \"The School Journal\" in 1897. Professor David Albert Jones of Oxford University writes that in the 19th century, it became popular for people to also use an angel to top the Christmas tree in order to symbolize the angels mentioned in the accounts of the Nativity of Jesus. Additionally, in the context of a Christian celebration of Christmas, the Christmas tree, being evergreen in colour, is symbolic of Christ, who offers eternal life; the candles or lights on the tree represent the Light of the World\u2014Jesus\u2014born in Bethlehem. Christian services for family use and public worship have been published for the blessing of a Christmas tree, after it has been erected. The Christmas tree is considered by some as Christianisation of pagan tradition and ritual surrounding the Winter Solstice, which included the use of evergreen boughs, and an adaptation of pagan tree worship; according to eighth-century biographer \u00c6ddi Stephanus, Saint Boniface (634\u2013709), who was a missionary in Germany, took an ax to an oak tree dedicated to Thor and pointed out a fir tree, which he stated was a more fitting object of reverence because it pointed to heaven and it had a triangular shape, which he said was symbolic of the Trinity. The English language phrase \"Christmas tree\" is first recorded in 1835 and represents an importation from the German language.\nSince the 16th century, the poinsettia, a native plant from Mexico, has been associated with Christmas carrying the Christian symbolism of the Star of Bethlehem; in that country it is known in Spanish as the \"Flower of the Holy Night\". Other popular holiday plants include holly, mistletoe, red amaryllis, and Christmas cactus.\nOther traditional decorations include bells, candles, candy canes, stockings, wreaths, and angels. Both the displaying of wreaths and candles in each window are a more traditional Christmas display. The concentric assortment of leaves, usually from an evergreen, make up Christmas wreaths and are designed to prepare Christians for the Advent season. Candles in each window are meant to demonstrate the fact that Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the ultimate light of the world.\nChristmas lights and banners may be hung along streets, music played from speakers, and Christmas trees placed in prominent places. It is common in many parts of the world for town squares and consumer shopping areas to sponsor and display decorations. Rolls of brightly colored paper with secular or religious Christmas motifs are manufactured for the purpose of wrapping gifts. In some countries, Christmas decorations are traditionally taken down on Twelfth Night.\nNativity play.\nFor the Christian celebration of Christmas, the viewing of the Nativity play is one of the oldest Christmastime traditions, with the first reenactment of the Nativity of Jesus taking place in A.D. 1223. In that year, Francis of Assisi assembled a Nativity scene outside of his church in Italy and children sung Christmas carols celebrating the birth of Jesus. Each year, this grew larger and people travelled from afar to see Francis' depiction of the Nativity of Jesus that came to feature drama and music. Nativity plays eventually spread throughout all of Europe, where they remain popular. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day church services often came to feature Nativity plays, as did schools and theatres. In France, Germany, Mexico and Spain, Nativity plays are often reenacted outdoors in the streets.\nMusic and carols.\nThe earliest extant specifically Christmas hymns appear in fourth-century Rome. Latin hymns such as \"Veni redemptor gentium\", written by Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to Arianism. \"Corde natus ex Parentis\" (\"Of the Father's love begotten\") by the Spanish poet Prudentius (d. 413) is still sung in some churches today. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas \"Sequence\" or \"Prose\" was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under Bernard of Clairvaux into a sequence of rhymed stanzas. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of St. Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional Christmas carol. Christmas carols in English appear in a 1426 work of John Awdlay who lists twenty five \"caroles of Cristemas\", probably sung by groups of 'wassailers', who went from house to house.\nThe songs now known specifically as carols were originally communal folk songs sung during celebrations such as \"harvest tide\" as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church. Traditionally, carols have often been based on medieval chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols like \"Personent hodie\", \"Good King Wenceslas\", and \"In dulci jubilo\" can be traced directly back to the Middle Ages. They are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. \"Adeste Fideles\" (O Come all ye faithful) appears in its current form in the mid-18th century.\nThe singing of carols increased in popularity after the Protestant Reformation in the Lutheran areas of Europe, as the Reformer Martin Luther wrote carols and encouraged their use in worship, in addition to spearheading the practice of caroling outside the Mass. The 18th-century English reformer Charles Wesley, an early Methodist divine, understood the importance of music to Christian worship. In addition to setting many psalms to melodies, he wrote texts for at least three Christmas carols. The best known was originally entitled \"Hark! How All the Welkin Rings\", later renamed \"Hark! the Herald Angels Sing\".\nChristmas seasonal songs of a nonreligious nature emerged in the late 18th century. The Welsh melody for \"Deck the Halls\" dates from 1794, with the lyrics added by Scottish musician Thomas Oliphant in 1862, and the American \"Jingle Bells\" was copyrighted in 1857. Other popular carols include \"The First Noel\", \"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\", \"The Holly and the Ivy\", \"I Saw Three Ships\", \"In the Bleak Midwinter\", \"Joy to the World\", \"Once in Royal David's City\" and \"While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks\". In the 19th and 20th centuries, African American spirituals and songs about Christmas, based in their tradition of spirituals, became more widely known. An increasing number of seasonal holiday songs were commercially produced in the 20th century, including jazz and blues variations. In addition, there was a revival of interest in early music, from groups singing folk music, such as The Revels, to performers of early medieval and classical music.\nOne of the most ubiquitous festive songs is \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\", which originates from the West Country of England in the 1930s. Radio has covered Christmas music from variety shows from the 1940s and 1950s, as well as modern-day stations that exclusively play Christmas music from late November through December 25. Hollywood movies have featured new Christmas music, such as \"White Christmas\" in \"Holiday Inn\" and \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\". Traditional carols have also been included in Hollywood films, such as \"Hark! the Herald Angels Sing\" in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), and \"Silent Night\" in \"A Christmas Story\".\nTraditional cuisine.\nA special Christmas family meal is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions have special meals for Christmas Eve, such as Sicily, where 12 kinds of fish are served. In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, goose or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider. Special desserts are also prepared, such as Christmas pudding, mince pies, Christmas cake, Panettone and Yule log cake. Traditional Christmas meal in Central Europe is fried carp or other fish.\nCards.\nChristmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding Christmas Day. The traditional greeting reads \"wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\", much like that of the first commercial Christmas card, produced by Sir Henry Cole in London in 1843. The custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging E-cards.\nChristmas cards are purchased in considerable quantities and feature artwork, commercially designed and relevant to the season. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative, with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem, or a white dove, which can represent both the Holy Spirit and Peace on Earth. Other Christmas cards are more secular and can depict Christmas traditions, mythical figures such as Santa Claus, objects directly associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, and baubles, or a variety of images associated with the season, such as Christmastide activities, snow scenes, and the wildlife of the northern winter.\nSome prefer cards with a poem, prayer, or Biblical verse; while others distance themselves from religion with an all-inclusive \"Season's greetings\".\nCommemorative stamps.\nA number of nations have issued commemorative stamps at Christmastide. Postal customers will often use these stamps to mail Christmas cards, and they are popular with philatelists. These stamps are regular postage stamps, unlike Christmas seals, and are valid for postage year-round. They usually go on sale sometime between early October and early December and are printed in considerable quantities.\nGift giving.\nThe exchanging of gifts is one of the core aspects of the modern Christmas celebration, making it the most profitable time of year for retailers and businesses throughout the world. On Christmas, people exchange gifts based on the Christian tradition associated with Saint Nicholas, and the gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh which were given to the baby Jesus by the Magi. The practice of gift giving in the Roman celebration of Saturnalia may have influenced Christian customs, but on the other hand the Christian \"core dogma of the Incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event\", because it was the Biblical Magi, \"together with all their fellow men, who received the gift of God through man's renewed participation in the divine life.\" However, Thomas J. Talley holds that the Roman Emperor Aurelian placed the alternate festival on December 25 in order to compete with the growing rate of the Christian Church, which had already been celebrating Christmas on that date first.\nGift-bearing figures.\nA number of figures are associated with Christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts. Among these are Father Christmas, also known as Santa Claus (derived from the Dutch for Saint Nicholas), P\u00e8re No\u00ebl, and the Weihnachtsmann; Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas; the Christkind; Kris Kringle; Joulupukki; tomte/nisse; Babbo Natale; Saint Basil; and Ded Moroz. The Scandinavian tomte (also called nisse) is sometimes depicted as a gnome instead of Santa Claus.\nThe best known of these figures today is red-dressed Santa Claus, of diverse origins. The name Santa Claus can be traced back to the Dutch \"Sinterklaas\", which means simply Saint Nicholas. Nicholas was a 4th-century Greek bishop of Myra, a city in the Roman province of Lycia, whose ruins are from modern Demre in southwest Turkey. Among other saintly attributes, he was noted for the care of children, generosity, and the giving of gifts. His feast day, December 6, came to be celebrated in many countries with the giving of gifts.\nSaint Nicholas traditionally appeared in bishop's attire, accompanied by helpers, inquiring about the behaviour of children during the past year before deciding whether they deserved a gift or not. By the 13th century, Saint Nicholas was well known in the Netherlands, and the practice of gift-giving in his name spread to other parts of central and southern Europe. At the Reformation in 16th\u201317th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or \"Christkindl\", corrupted in English to Kris Kringle, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.\nThe modern popular image of Santa Claus, however, was created in the United States, and in particular in New York. The transformation was accomplished with the aid of notable contributors including Washington Irving and the German-American cartoonist Thomas Nast (1840\u20131902). Following the American Revolutionary War, some of the inhabitants of New York City sought out symbols of the city's non-English past. New York had originally been established as the Dutch colonial town of New Amsterdam and the Dutch Sinterklaas tradition was reinvented as Saint Nicholas.\nCurrent tradition in several Latin American countries (such as Venezuela and Colombia) holds that while Santa makes the toys, he then gives them to the Baby Jesus, who is the one who actually delivers them to the children's homes, a reconciliation between traditional religious beliefs and the iconography of Santa Claus imported from the United States.\nIn South Tyrol (Italy), Austria, Czech Republic, Southern Germany, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Slovakia, and Switzerland, the Christkind (Je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ek in Czech, J\u00e9zuska in Hungarian and Je\u017ei\u0161ko in Slovak) brings the presents. Greek children get their presents from Saint Basil on New Year's Eve, the eve of that saint's liturgical feast. The German St. Nikolaus is not identical with the Weihnachtsmann (who is the German version of Santa Claus / Father Christmas). St. Nikolaus wears a bishop's dress and still brings small gifts (usually candies, nuts, and fruits) on December 6 and is accompanied by Knecht Ruprecht. Although many parents around the world routinely teach their children about Santa Claus and other gift bringers, some have come to reject this practice, considering it deceptive.\nMultiple gift-giver figures exist in Poland, varying between regions and individual families. St Nicholas (\"\u015awi\u0119ty Miko\u0142aj\") dominates Central and North-East areas, the Starman (\"Gwiazdor\") is most common in Greater Poland, Baby Jesus (\"Dzieci\u0105tko\") is unique to Upper Silesia, with the Little Star (\"Gwiazdka\") and the Little Angel (\"Anio\u0142ek\") being common in the South and the South-East. Grandfather Frost (\"Dziadek Mr\u00f3z\") is less commonly accepted in some areas of Eastern Poland. It is worth noting that across all of Poland, St Nicholas is the gift giver on the Saint Nicholas Day on December 6.\nDate according to Julian calendar.\nSome jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church, including those of Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Jerusalem, mark feasts using the older Julian calendar. As of 2023, there is a difference of 13 days between the Julian calendar and the modern Gregorian calendar, which is used internationally for most secular purposes. As a result, December 25 on the Julian calendar currently corresponds to January 7 on the calendar used by most governments and people in everyday life. Therefore, the aforementioned Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the day that is internationally considered to be January 7. On 18 October 2022 the Orthodox Church of Ukraine allowed its dioceses to hold Christmas services according to the Revised Julian calendar, i.e., December 25.\nHowever, following the Council of Constantinople in 1923, other Orthodox Christians, such as those belonging to the jurisdictions of Constantinople, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Antioch, Alexandria, Albania, Cyprus, Finland, and the Orthodox Church in America, among others, began using the Revised Julian calendar, which at present corresponds exactly to the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, these Orthodox Christians mark December 25 (and thus Christmas) on the same day that is internationally considered to be December 25.\nA further complication is added by the fact that the Armenian Apostolic Church continues the original ancient Eastern Christian practice of celebrating the birth of Christ not as a separate holiday, but on the same day as the celebration of his baptism (Theophany), which is on January 6. This is a public holiday in Armenia, and it is held on the same day that is internationally considered to be January 6, because since 1923 the Armenian Church in Armenia has used the Gregorian calendar.\nHowever, there is also a small Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which maintains the traditional Armenian custom of celebrating the birth of Christ on the same day as Theophany (January 6), but uses the \"Julian\" calendar for the determination of that date. As a result, this church celebrates \"Christmas\" (more properly called Theophany) on the day that is considered January 19 on the Gregorian calendar in use by the majority of the world.\nIn summary, there are four different dates used by different Christian groups to mark the birth of Christ, given in the table below.\nEconomy.\nChristmas is typically a peak selling season for retailers in many nations around the world. Sales increase dramatically as people purchase gifts, decorations, and supplies to celebrate. In the United States, the \"Christmas shopping season\" starts as early as October. In Canada, merchants begin advertising campaigns just before Halloween (October 31), and step up their marketing following Remembrance Day on November 11. In the UK and Ireland, the Christmas shopping season starts from mid-November, around the time when high street Christmas lights are turned on. In the United States, it has been calculated that a quarter of all personal spending takes place during the Christmas/holiday shopping season. Figures from the U.S. Census Bureau reveal that expenditure in department stores nationwide rose from $20.8\u00a0billion in November 2004 to $31.9\u00a0billion in December 2004, an increase of 54 percent. In other sectors, the pre-Christmas increase in spending was even greater, there being a November\u2013December buying surge of 100 percent in bookstores and 170 percent in jewelry stores. In the same year employment in American retail stores rose from 1.6\u00a0million to 1.8\u00a0million in the two months leading up to Christmas. Industries completely dependent on Christmas include Christmas cards, of which 1.9\u00a0billion are sent in the United States each year, and live Christmas Trees, of which 20.8\u00a0million were cut in the U.S. in 2002. For 2019, the average US adult was projected to spend $920 on gifts alone. In the UK in 2010, up to \u00a38\u00a0billion was expected to be spent online at Christmas, approximately a quarter of total retail festive sales.\nIn most Western nations, Christmas Day is the least active day of the year for business and commerce; almost all retail, commercial and institutional businesses are closed, and almost all industries cease activity (more than any other day of the year), whether laws require such or not. In England and Wales, the Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004 prevents all large shops from trading on Christmas Day. Similar legislation was approved in Scotland in 2007. Film studios release many high-budget movies during the holiday season, including Christmas films, fantasy movies or high-tone dramas with high production values to hopes of maximizing the chance of nominations for the Academy Awards.\nOne economist's analysis calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a deadweight loss under orthodox microeconomic theory, because of the effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as the difference between what the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4\u00a0billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone. Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as white elephants, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.\nControversies.\nChristmas has at times been the subject of controversy and attacks from various sources, both Christian and non-Christian. Historically, it was prohibited by Puritans during their ascendency in the Commonwealth of England (1647\u20131660), and in Colonial New England where the Puritans outlawed the celebration of Christmas in 1659 on the grounds that Christmas was not mentioned in Scripture and therefore violated the Reformed regulative principle of worship. The Parliament of Scotland, which was dominated by Presbyterians, passed a series of acts outlawing the observance of Christmas between 1637 and 1690; Christmas Day did not become a public holiday in Scotland until 1871. Today, some conservative Reformed denominations such as the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland and the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America likewise reject the celebration of Christmas based on the regulative principle and what they see as its non-Scriptural origin. Christmas celebrations have also been prohibited by atheist states such as the Soviet Union and more recently majority Muslim states such as Somalia, Tajikistan and Brunei.\nSome Christians and organizations such as Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice cite alleged attacks on Christmas (dubbing them a \"war on Christmas\"). Such groups claim that any specific mention of the term \"Christmas\" or its religious aspects is being increasingly censored, avoided, or discouraged by a number of advertisers, retailers, government (prominently schools), and other public and private organizations. One controversy is the occurrence of Christmas trees being renamed Holiday trees. In the U.S. there has been a tendency to replace the greeting \"Merry Christmas\" with \"Happy Holidays\", which is considered inclusive at the time of the Jewish celebration of Hanukkah. In the U.S. and Canada, where the use of the term \"Holidays\" is most prevalent, opponents have denounced its usage and avoidance of using the term \"Christmas\" as being politically correct. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Lynch v. Donnelly\" that a Christmas display (which included a Nativity scene) owned and displayed by the city of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, did not violate the First Amendment. American Muslim scholar Abdul Malik Mujahid has said that Muslims must treat Christmas with respect, even if they disagree with it.\nThe government of the People's Republic of China officially espouses state atheism, and has conducted antireligious campaigns to this end. In December 2018, officials raided Christian churches prior to Christmastide and coerced them to close; Christmas trees and Santa Clauses were also forcibly removed.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Contractive maps are sometimes called Lipschitzian maps. If the above condition is instead satisfied for\n\"k\"\u00a0\u2264\u00a01, then the mapping is said to be a non-expansive map.\nMore generally, the idea of a contractive mapping can be defined for maps between metric spaces. Thus, if (\"M\",\u2009\"d\") and (\"N\",\u2009\"d\"') are two metric spaces, then formula_3 is a contractive mapping if there is a constant formula_1 such that\nformula_5\nfor all \"x\" and \"y\" in \"M\".\nEvery contraction mapping is Lipschitz continuous and hence uniformly continuous (for a Lipschitz continuous function, the constant \"k\" is no longer necessarily less than 1).\nA contraction mapping has at most one fixed point. Moreover, the Banach fixed-point theorem states that every contraction mapping on a non-empty complete metric space has a unique fixed point, and that for any \"x\" in \"M\" the iterated function sequence \"x\", \"f\"\u2009(\"x\"), \"f\"\u2009(\"f\"\u2009(\"x\")), \"f\"\u2009(\"f\"\u2009(\"f\"\u2009(\"x\"))), ... converges to the fixed point. This concept is very useful for iterated function systems where contraction mappings are often used. Banach's fixed-point theorem is also applied in proving the existence of solutions of ordinary differential equations, and is used in one proof of the inverse function theorem.\nContraction mappings play an important role in dynamic programming problems.\nFirmly non-expansive mapping.\nA non-expansive mapping with formula_6 can be generalized to a firmly non-expansive mapping in a Hilbert space formula_7 if the following holds for all \"x\" and \"y\" in formula_7:\nformula_9\nwhere\nformula_10.\nThis is a special case of formula_11 averaged nonexpansive operators with formula_12. A firmly non-expansive mapping is always non-expansive, via the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality.\nThe class of firmly non-expansive maps is closed under convex combinations, but not compositions. This class includes proximal mappings of proper, convex, lower-semicontinuous functions, hence it also includes orthogonal projections onto non-empty closed convex sets. The class of firmly nonexpansive operators is equal to the set of resolvents of maximally monotone operators. Surprisingly, while iterating non-expansive maps has no guarantee to find a fixed point (e.g. multiplication by -1), firm non-expansiveness is sufficient to guarantee global convergence to a fixed point, provided a fixed point exists. More precisely, if formula_13, then for any initial point formula_14, iterating\nformula_15\nyields convergence to a fixed point formula_16. This convergence might be weak in an infinite-dimensional setting.\nSubcontraction map.\nA subcontraction map or subcontractor is a map \"f\" on a metric space (\"M\",\u2009\"d\") such that\nformula_17\nformula_18\nIf the image of a subcontractor \"f\" is compact, then \"f\" has a fixed point.\nLocally convex spaces.\nIn a locally convex space (\"E\",\u2009\"P\") with topology given by a set \"P\" of seminorms, one can define for any \"p\"\u2009\u2208\u2009\"P\" a \"p\"-contraction as a map \"f\" such that there is some \"k\"\"p\" &lt; 1 such that \"p\"(\"f\"(\"x\") \u2212 \"f\"(\"y\")) \u2264 \"kp p\"(\"x\" \u2212 \"y\").

These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs. The stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding. For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full valence shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration. In organic chemistry, covalent bonding is much more common than ionic bonding.\nCovalent bonding also includes many kinds of interactions, including \u03c3-bonding, \u03c0-bonding, metal-to-metal bonding, agostic interactions, bent bonds, three-center two-electron bonds and three-center four-electron bonds. The term \"covalent bond\" dates from 1939. The prefix \"co-\" means \"jointly, associated in action, partnered to a lesser degree, \" etc.; thus a \"co-valent bond\", in essence, means that the atoms share \"valence\", such as is discussed in valence bond theory.\nIn the molecule H2, the hydrogen atoms share the two electrons via covalent bonding. Covalency is greatest between atoms of similar electronegativities. Thus, covalent bonding does not necessarily require that the two atoms be of the same elements, only that they be of comparable electronegativity. Covalent bonding that entails the sharing of electrons over more than two atoms is said to be delocalized.\nHistory.\nThe term \"covalence\" in regard to bonding was first used in 1919 by Irving Langmuir in a \"Journal of the American Chemical Society\" article entitled \"The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules\". Langmuir wrote that \"we shall denote by the term \"covalence\" the number of pairs of electrons that a given atom shares with its neighbors.\"\nThe idea of covalent bonding can be traced several years before 1919 to Gilbert N. Lewis, who in 1916 described the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. He introduced the \"Lewis notation\" or \"electron dot notation\" or \"Lewis dot structure\", in which valence electrons (those in the outer shell) are represented as dots around the atomic symbols. Pairs of electrons located between atoms represent covalent bonds. Multiple pairs represent multiple bonds, such as double bonds and triple bonds. An alternative form of representation, not shown here, has bond-forming electron pairs represented as solid lines.\nLewis proposed that an atom forms enough covalent bonds to form a full (or closed) outer electron shell. In the diagram of methane shown here, the carbon atom has a valence of four and is, therefore, surrounded by eight electrons (the octet rule), four from the carbon itself and four from the hydrogens bonded to it. Each hydrogen has a valence of one and is surrounded by two electrons (a duet rule) \u2013 its own one electron plus one from the carbon. The numbers of electrons correspond to full shells in the quantum theory of the atom; the outer shell of a carbon atom is the \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a02 shell, which can hold eight electrons, whereas the outer (and only) shell of a hydrogen atom is the \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a01 shell, which can hold only two.\nWhile the idea of shared electron pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of covalent bonding, quantum mechanics is needed to understand the nature of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules. Walter Heitler and Fritz London are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a chemical bond (molecular hydrogen) in 1927. Their work was based on the valence bond model, which assumes that a chemical bond is formed when there is good overlap between the atomic orbitals of participating atoms.\nTypes of covalent bonds.\nAtomic orbitals (except for s orbitals) have specific directional properties leading to different types of covalent bonds. Sigma (\u03c3) bonds are the strongest covalent bonds and are due to head-on overlapping of orbitals on two different atoms. A single bond is usually a \u03c3 bond. Pi (\u03c0) bonds are weaker and are due to lateral overlap between p (or d) orbitals. A double bond between two given atoms consists of one \u03c3 and one \u03c0 bond, and a triple bond is one \u03c3 and two \u03c0 bonds.\nCovalent bonds are also affected by the electronegativity of the connected atoms which determines the chemical polarity of the bond. Two atoms with equal electronegativity will make nonpolar covalent bonds such as H\u2013H. An unequal relationship creates a polar covalent bond such as with H\u2212Cl. However polarity also requires geometric asymmetry, or else dipoles may cancel out, resulting in a non-polar molecule.\nCovalent structures.\nThere are several types of structures for covalent substances, including individual molecules, molecular structures, macromolecular structures and giant covalent structures. Individual molecules have strong bonds that hold the atoms together, but generally, there are negligible forces of attraction between molecules. Such covalent substances are usually gases, for example, HCl, SO2, CO2, and CH4. In molecular structures, there are weak forces of attraction. Such covalent substances are low-boiling-temperature liquids (such as ethanol), and low-melting-temperature solids (such as iodine and solid CO2). Macromolecular structures have large numbers of atoms linked by covalent bonds in chains, including synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and nylon, and biopolymers such as proteins and starch. Network covalent structures (or giant covalent structures) contain large numbers of atoms linked in sheets (such as graphite), or 3-dimensional structures (such as diamond and quartz). These substances have high melting and boiling points, are frequently brittle, and tend to have high electrical resistivity. Elements that have high electronegativity, and the ability to form three or four electron pair bonds, often form such large macromolecular structures.\nOne- and three-electron bonds.\nBonds with one or three electrons can be found in radical species, which have an odd number of electrons. The simplest example of a 1-electron bond is found in the dihydrogen cation, H2+. One-electron bonds often have about half the bond energy of a 2-electron bond, and are therefore called \"half bonds\". However, there are exceptions: in the case of dilithium, the bond is actually stronger for the 1-electron Li2+ than for the 2-electron Li2. This exception can be explained in terms of hybridization and inner-shell effects.\nThe simplest example of three-electron bonding can be found in the helium dimer cation, He2+. It is considered a \"half bond\" because it consists of only one shared electron (rather than two); in molecular orbital terms, the third electron is in an anti-bonding orbital which cancels out half of the bond formed by the other two electrons. Another example of a molecule containing a 3-electron bond, in addition to two 2-electron bonds, is nitric oxide, NO. The oxygen molecule, O2 can also be regarded as having two 3-electron bonds and one 2-electron bond, which accounts for its paramagnetism and its formal bond order of 2. Chlorine dioxide and its heavier analogues bromine dioxide and iodine dioxide also contain three-electron bonds.\nMolecules with odd-electron bonds are usually highly reactive. These types of bond are only stable between atoms with similar electronegativities.\nResonance.\nThere are situations whereby a single Lewis structure is insufficient to explain the electron configuration in a molecule and its resulting experimentally-determined properties, hence a superposition of structures is needed. The same two atoms in such molecules can be bonded differently in different Lewis structures (a single bond in one, a double bond in another, or even none at all), resulting in a non-integer bond order. The nitrate ion is one such example with three equivalent structures. The bond between the nitrogen and each oxygen is a double bond in one structure and a single bond in the other two, so that the average bond order for each N\u2013O interaction is = .\nAromaticity.\nIn organic chemistry, when a molecule with a planar ring obeys H\u00fcckel's rule, where the number of \u03c0 electrons fit the formula 4\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a02 (where \"n\" is an integer), it attains extra stability and symmetry. In benzene, the prototypical aromatic compound, there are 6 \u03c0 bonding electrons (\"n\"\u00a0=\u00a01, 4\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a02\u00a0=\u00a06). These occupy three delocalized \u03c0 molecular orbitals (molecular orbital theory) or form conjugate \u03c0 bonds in two resonance structures that linearly combine (valence bond theory), creating a regular hexagon exhibiting a greater stabilization than the hypothetical 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene.\nIn the case of heterocyclic aromatics and substituted benzenes, the electronegativity differences between different parts of the ring may dominate the chemical behavior of aromatic ring bonds, which otherwise are equivalent.\nHypervalence.\nCertain molecules such as xenon difluoride and sulfur hexafluoride have higher co-ordination numbers than would be possible due to strictly covalent bonding according to the octet rule. This is explained by the three-center four-electron bond (\"3c\u20134e\") model which interprets the molecular wavefunction in terms of non-bonding highest occupied molecular orbitals in molecular orbital theory and resonance of sigma bonds in valence bond theory.\nElectron deficiency.\nIn three-center two-electron bonds (\"3c\u20132e\") three atoms share two electrons in bonding. This type of bonding occurs in boron hydrides such as diborane (B2H6), which are often described as electron deficient because there are not enough valence electrons to form localized (2-centre 2-electron) bonds joining all the atoms. However the more modern description using 3c\u20132e bonds does provide enough bonding orbitals to connect all the atoms, so that the molecules can instead be classified as electron-precise.\nEach such bond (2 per molecule in diborane) contains a pair of electrons which connect the boron atoms to each other in a banana shape, with a proton (the nucleus of a hydrogen atom) in the middle of the bond, sharing electrons with both boron atoms. In certain cluster compounds, so-called four-center two-electron bonds also have been postulated.\nQuantum mechanical description.\nAfter the development of quantum mechanics, two basic theories were proposed to provide a quantum description of chemical bonding: valence bond (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory. A more recent quantum description is given in terms of atomic contributions to the electronic density of states.\nComparison of VB and MO theories.\nThe two theories represent two ways to build up the electron configuration of the molecule. For valence bond theory, the atomic hybrid orbitals are filled with electrons first to produce a fully bonded valence configuration, followed by performing a linear combination of contributing structures (resonance) if there are several of them. In contrast, for molecular orbital theory a linear combination of atomic orbitals is performed first, followed by filling of the resulting molecular orbitals with electrons.\nThe two approaches are regarded as complementary, and each provides its own insights into the problem of chemical bonding. As valence bond theory builds the molecular wavefunction out of localized bonds, it is more suited for the calculation of bond energies and the understanding of reaction mechanisms. As molecular orbital theory builds the molecular wavefunction out of delocalized orbitals, it is more suited for the calculation of ionization energies and the understanding of spectral absorption bands.\nAt the qualitative level, both theories contain incorrect predictions. Simple (Heitler\u2013London) valence bond theory correctly predicts the dissociation of homonuclear diatomic molecules into separate atoms, while simple (Hartree\u2013Fock) molecular orbital theory incorrectly predicts dissociation into a mixture of atoms and ions. On the other hand, simple molecular orbital theory correctly predicts H\u00fcckel's rule of aromaticity, while simple valence bond theory incorrectly predicts that cyclobutadiene has larger resonance energy than benzene.\nAlthough the wavefunctions generated by both theories at the qualitative level do not agree and do not match the stabilization energy by experiment, they can be corrected by configuration interaction. This is done by combining the valence bond covalent function with the functions describing all possible ionic structures or by combining the molecular orbital ground state function with the functions describing all possible excited states using unoccupied orbitals. It can then be seen that the simple molecular orbital approach overestimates the weight of the ionic structures while the simple valence bond approach neglects them. This can also be described as saying that the simple molecular orbital approach neglects electron correlation while the simple valence bond approach overestimates it.\nModern calculations in quantum chemistry usually start from (but ultimately go far beyond) a molecular orbital rather than a valence bond approach, not because of any intrinsic superiority in the former but rather because the MO approach is more readily adapted to numerical computations. Molecular orbitals are orthogonal, which significantly increases the feasibility and speed of computer calculations compared to nonorthogonal valence bond orbitals.\nCovalency from atomic contribution to the electronic density of states.\nIn COOP, COHP and BCOOP, evaluation of bond covalency is dependent on the basis set. To overcome this issue, an alternative formulation of the bond covalency can be provided in this way.\nThe center mass of an atomic orbital formula_1 with quantum numbers for atom A is defined as\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3 is the contribution of the atomic orbital formula_4 of the atom A to the total electronic density of states of the solid\nformula_5\nwhere the outer sum runs over all atoms A of the unit cell. The energy window is chosen in such a way that it encompasses all of the relevant bands participating in the bond. If the range to select is unclear, it can be identified in practice by examining the molecular orbitals that describe the electron density along with the considered bond.\nThe relative position } of the center mass of formula_6 levels of atom A with respect to the center mass of formula_7 levels of atom B is given as\nformula_8\nwhere the contributions of the magnetic and spin quantum numbers are summed. According to this definition, the relative position of the A levels with respect to the B levels is\nformula_9\nwhere, for simplicity, we may omit the dependence from the principal quantum number in the notation referring to \nIn this formalism, the greater the value of the higher the overlap of the selected atomic bands, and thus the electron density described by those orbitals gives a more covalent bond. The quantity } is denoted as the \"covalency\" of the bond, which is specified in the same units of the energy .\nAnalogous effect in nuclear systems.\nAn analogous effect to covalent binding is believed to occur in some nuclear systems, with the difference that the shared fermions are quarks rather than electrons. High energy proton-proton scattering cross-section indicates that quark interchange of either u or d quarks is the dominant process of the nuclear force at short distance. In particular, it dominates over the Yukawa interaction where a meson is exchanged. Therefore, covalent binding by quark interchange is expected to be the dominating mechanism of nuclear binding at small distance when the bound hadrons have covalence quarks in common.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The earlier term 'polycondensation' was synonymous with 'condensation polymerization'. The current definitions of polycondensation and condensative chain polymerization were both embraced by the earlier term 'polycondensation'.\nCondensation polymerization is a form of step-growth polymerization. Linear polymers are produced from bifunctional monomers, i.e. compounds with two reactive end-groups. Common condensation polymers include polyamides, polyacetals, and proteins.\nPolyamides.\nOne important class of condensation polymers are polyamides. They arise from the reaction of carboxylic acid and an amine. Examples include nylons and proteins.

It is the largest city in El Paso County with a population of 478,961 at the 2020 United States Census, a 15.02% increase since 2010. Colorado Springs is the second-most populous city and the most extensive city in the state of Colorado, and the 40th-most populous city in the United States. It is the principal city in the Colorado Springs metropolitan area and the second-most prominent city of the Front Range Urban Corridor. It is located in east-central Colorado, on Fountain Creek, south of Denver.\nAt the city stands over above sea level. Colorado Springs is near the base of Pikes Peak, which rises above sea level on the eastern edge of the Southern Rocky Mountains. The city is the largest city north of Mexico above 6000 feet in elevation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nThe Ute, Arapaho and Cheyenne peoples were the first recorded inhabiting the area which would become Colorado Springs. Part of the territory included in the United States' 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the current city area was designated part of the 1854 Kansas Territory. In 1859, after the first local settlement was established, it became part of the Jefferson Territory on October 24 and of El Paso County on November 28. Colorado City at the Front Range confluence of Fountain and Camp creeks was \"formally organized on August13, 1859\" during the Pikes Peak Gold Rush. It served as the capital of the Colorado Territory from November 5, 1861, until August 14, 1862, when the capital was moved to Golden, before it was finally moved to Denver in 1867. So many immigrants from England had settled in Colorado Springs by the early 1870s that Colorado Springs was locally referred to as \"Little London.\" In 1871 the Colorado Springs Company laid out the towns of La Font (later called Manitou Springs) and Fountain Colony, upstream and downstream respectively, of Colorado City. Within a year, Fountain Colony was renamed Colorado Springs and officially incorporated. The El Paso County seat shifted from Colorado City in 1873 to the Town of Colorado Springs. On December 1, 1880, Colorado Springs expanded northward with two annexations.\nThe second period of annexations was during 1889\u201390, and included Seavey's Addition, West Colorado Springs, East End, and another North End addition. In 1891 the Broadmoor Land Company built the Broadmoor suburb, which included the Broadmoor Casino, and by December 12, 1895, the city had \"four Mining Exchanges and 275 mining brokers.\" By 1898, the city was designated into quadrants by the north-south Cascade Avenue and the east-west Washington/Pikes Peak avenues.\nFrom 1899 to 1901 Tesla Experimental Station operated on Knob Hill, and aircraft flights to the Broadmoor's neighboring fields began in 1919. Alexander Airport north of the city opened in 1925, and in 1927 the original Colorado Springs Municipal Airport land was purchased east of the city.\nThe city's military presence began during World War II, beginning with Camp Carson (now the 135,000-acre Fort Carson base) that was established in 1941. During the war, the United States Army Air Forces leased land adjacent to the municipal airfield, naming it Peterson Field in December 1942.\nIn November 1950, Ent Air Force Base was selected as the Cold War headquarters for Air Defense Command (ADC). The former WWII Army Air Base, Peterson Field, which had been inactivated at the end of the war, was re-opened in 1951 as a U.S. Air Force base. \u00a0North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was established as a hardened command and control center within the Cheyenne Mountain Complex during the Cold War. \nBetween 1965 and 1968, the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, Pikes Peak State College and Colorado Technical University were established in or near the city. In 1977 most of the former Ent AFB became a US Olympic training center. The Libertarian Party was founded within the city in the 1970s.\nOn October 1, 1981, the Broadmoor Addition, Cheyenne Canon, Ivywild, Skyway, and Stratton Meadows were annexed after the Colorado Supreme Court \"overturned a district court decision that voided the annexation\". Further annexations expanding the city include the Nielson Addition and Vineyard Commerce Park Annexation in September 2008.\nGeography.\nThe city lies in a semi-arid Steppe climate region with the Southern Rocky Mountains to the west, the Palmer Divide to the north, high plains further east, and high desert lands to the south when leaving Fountain and approaching Pueblo. Colorado Springs is or one hour and five minutes south of Denver by car using I-25.\nColorado Springs has the greatest total area of any municipality in Colorado. At the 2020 United States Census, the city had a total area of including of water.\nMetropolitan area.\nColorado Springs has many features of a modern urban area such as parks, bike trails, and open spaces. However, it is not exempt from problems that typically plague cities experiencing tremendous growth such as overcrowded roads and highways, crime, sprawl, and government budgetary issues. Many of the problems are indirectly or directly caused by the city's difficulty in coping with the large population growth experienced since 1997, and the annexation of the Banning Lewis Ranch area to accommodate further population growth of 175,000 future residents.\nClimate.\nColorado Springs has a cooler, dry-winter semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen \"BSk\"), and its location just east of the Rocky Mountains affords it the rapid warming influence from chinook winds during winter but also subjects it to drastic day-to-day variability in weather conditions. The city has abundant sunshine year-round, averaging 243 sunny days per year, and receives approximately of annual precipitation. Due to unusually low precipitation for several years after flooding in 1999, Colorado Springs enacted lawn water restrictions in 2002. These were lifted in 2005 but permanently reinstated in December 2019.\nColorado Springs is one of the most active lightning strike areas in the United States. This natural phenomenon led Nikola Tesla to select Colorado Springs as the preferred location to build his lab and study electricity.\nSeasonal climate.\nDecember is typically the coldest month, averaging . Historically, January had been the coldest month, but, in recent years, December has had both lower daily maxima and minima. Typically, there are 5.2 nights with sub- lows and 23.6 days where the high does not rise above freezing.\nSnowfall is usually moderate and remains on the ground briefly because of direct sun, with the city receiving per season, although the mountains to the west often receive in excess of triple that amount; March is the snowiest month in the region, both by total accumulation and number of days with measurable snowfall. In addition, 8 of the top 10 heaviest 24-hour snowfalls have occurred from March to May. Summers are warm, with July, the warmest month, averaging , and 18 days of + highs annually. Due to the high elevation and aridity, nights are usually relatively cool and rarely does the low remain above . Dry weather generally prevails, but brief afternoon thunderstorms are common, especially in July and August when the city receives the majority of its annual rainfall, due to the North American monsoon.\nThe first autumn freeze and the last freeze in the spring, on average, occur on October 2 and May 6, respectively; the average window for measurable snowfall (\u2265) is October 21 through April 25. Extreme temperatures range from on June 26, 2012 and most recently on June 21, 2016, down to on February 1, 1951, and December 9, 1919.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2020 United States Census, the population of the City of Colorado Springs was 478,961 (40th most populous U.S. city), the population of the Colorado Springs Metropolitan Statistical Area was 755,105 (79th most populous MSA), and the population of the Front Range Urban Corridor was 5,055,344.\nAs of the April 2010 census, 78.8% of the population of the city was White (non-Hispanic Whites were 70.7% of the population, compared with 86.6% in 1970), 16.1% Hispanic or Latino of any race (compared with 7.4% in 1970), 6.3% Black or African American, 3.0% Asian, 1.0% descended from indigenous peoples of the Americas, 0.3% descended from indigenous Hawaiians and other Pacific islanders, 5.5% of some other race, and 5.1% of two or more races. Mexican Americans made up 14.6% of the city's population, compared with 9.1% in 1990. The median age in the city was 35 years.\nEconomy.\nColorado Springs's economy is driven primarily by the military, the high-tech industry, and tourism, in that order. The city is experiencing growth in the service sectors. In June 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment rate was 3.3%. The state's unemployment rate in June 2022 was 3.4% compared to 3.6% for the nation.\nMilitary.\nAs of 2021[ [update]], there are nearly 45,000 active-duty troops in Colorado Springs. There are more than 100,000 veterans and thousands of reservists. The military and defense contractors supply more than 40% of the Pikes Peak region's economy.\nColorado Springs is home to the Peterson Space Force Base, Schriever Space Force Base, Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station, U.S. Space Command, and Space Operations Command\u2014 the largest contingent of space service military installations. They are responsible for intelligence gathering, space operations, and cyber missions. \nPeterson Space Force Base is responsible for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) headquarters, Space Operations Command, and Space Deltas 2, 3, and 7. Located at Peterson is the 302nd Airlift Wing, an Air Force Reserve unit, that transports passengers and cargo and fights wildfires.\nSchriever Space Force Base is responsible for Joint Task Force-Space Defense and Space Deltas 6, 8, and 9. The NORAD and USNORTHCOM Alternate Command Center is located at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex. Within the mountain complex, the Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station has been operated by Space Operations Command. On January 13, 2021, the Air Force announced a new permanent home for Space Command, moving it from Colorado Springs to Huntsville, Alabama in 2026, but the decision could be reversed by Congress.\nArmy divisions are trained and stationed at Fort Carson. The United States Air Force Academy was established after World War II, on land donated by the City of Colorado Springs.\nDefense industry.\nThe defense industry forms a significant part of the Colorado Springs economy, with some of the city's largest employers being defense contractors. Some defense corporations have left or downsized city campuses, but slight growth has been recorded. Significant defense corporations in the city include Northrop Grumman, Boeing, General Dynamics, L3Harris Technologies, SAIC, ITT, Lockheed Martin, and Bluestaq. The Space Foundation is based in Colorado Springs.\nHigh-tech industry.\nA large percentage of Colorado Springs's economy is still based on manufacturing high-tech and complex electronic equipment. The high-tech sector in the Colorado Springs area has decreased its overall presence from 2000 to 2006 (from around 21,000 to around 8,000), with notable reductions in information technology and complex electronic equipment. Current trends project the high-tech employment ratio will continue to decrease.\nHigh-tech corporations with connections to the city include: Verizon Business, a telecommunications firm, at its height had nearly 1300 employees in 2008. Hewlett-Packard still has some sales, support, and SAN storage engineering center for the computer industry. Storage Networking Industry Association is the home of the SNIA Technology Center. Keysight Technologies, spun off in 2014 from Agilent, which was itself spun off from HP in 1999 as an independent, publicly traded company, has its oscilloscope research and development division based in Colorado Springs. Intel had 250 employees in 2009. The Intel facility is now used for the centralized unemployment offices, social services, El Paso county offices, and a bitcoin mining facility. Microchip Technology (formerly Atmel), is a chip fabrication organization. The Apple Inc. facility was sold to Sanmina-SCI in 1996.\nCulture and contemporary life.\nTourism.\nAlmost immediately following the arrival of railroads beginning in 1871, the city's location at the base of Pikes Peak and the Rocky Mountains made it a popular tourism destination. Tourism is the third largest employer in the Pikes Peak region, accounting for more than 16,000 jobs. In 2018, 23 million day and overnight visitors came to the area, contributing $2.4\u00a0billion in revenue.\nColorado Springs has more than 55 attractions and activities in the area, including Garden of the Gods park, United States Air Force Academy, the ANA Money Museum, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center at Colorado College, Old Colorado City, The National Museum of World War II Aviation, and the U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Training Center. In 2020, the U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Museum opened; the Flying W Ranch Chuckwagon Dinner &amp; Western Show reopened in 2020. A new Pikes Peak Summit Complex opened at the 14,115-foot summit in 2021. The Manitou and Pikes Peak Railway also reopened in 2021.\nThe downtown Colorado Springs Visitor Information Center offers free area information to leisure and business travelers. The Cultural Office of the Pikes Peak Region (COPPeR), also downtown, supports and advocates for the arts throughout the Pikes Peak Region. It operates the PeakRadar website to communicate city events.\nAnnual cultural events.\nColorado Springs is home to the annual Colorado Springs Labor Day Lift Off, a hot air balloon festival that takes place over Labor Day weekend at the city's Memorial Park.\nOther annual events include: a comic book convention and science fiction convention called GalaxyFest in February, a pride parade called PrideFest in July, the Greek Festival, the Pikes Peak Ascent and Marathon, and the Steers &amp; Beers Whiskey and Beer Festival in August, and the Emma Crawford Coffin Races and Festival in nearby Manitou Springs and Arts Month in October.\nThe Colorado Springs Festival of Lights Parade is held the first Saturday in December. The parade is held on Tejon Street in Downtown Colorado Springs.\nBreweries.\nIn 2017, Colorado had the third-most craft breweries at 348. Breweries and microbreweries have become popular in Colorado Springs, which hosts over 30 of them.\nReligious institutions.\nAlthough houses of worship of almost every major world religion are within the city, Colorado Springs has in particular attracted a large influx of Evangelical Christians and Christian organizations in recent years. At one time Colorado Springs was the national headquarters for 81 different religious organizations, earning the city the tongue-in-cheek nicknames \"the Evangelical Vatican\" and \"The Christian Mecca.\" \nReligious groups with regional or international headquarters in Colorado Springs include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMarijuana.\nAlthough Colorado voters approved Colorado Amendment 64, a constitutional amendment in 2012 legalizing retail sales of marijuana for recreational purposes, the Colorado Springs city council voted not to permit retail shops in the city, as was allowed in the amendment. Medical marijuana outlets continue to operate in Colorado Springs. In 2015, there were 91 medical marijuana clinics in the city, which reported sales of $59.6\u00a0million in 2014, up 11 percent from the previous year but without recreational marijuana shops. On April 26, 2016, Colorado Springs city council decided to extend the current six-month moratorium to eighteen months with no new licenses to be granted until May 2017. A scholarly paper suggested the city would give up $25.4\u00a0million in tax revenue and fees if the city continued to thwart the industry from opening within the city limits. As of March 1, 2018, there were 131 medical marijuana centers and no recreational cannabis stores.

It is a National Natural Landmark, with red/orange sandstone rock formations often viewed against a backdrop of the snow-capped Pikes Peak. This park is free to the public and offers many recreational opportunities, such as hiking, rock climbing, cycling, horseback riding and tours. It offers a variety of annual events, one of the most popular of which is the Starlight Spectacular, a recreational bike ride held every summer to benefit the Trails and Open Space Coalition of Colorado Springs.\nColorado Springs has several major city parks, such as Palmer Park, America the Beautiful Park in downtown, Memorial Park, which includes many sports fields, an indoor swimming pool and skating rink, a skateboard bowl and two half-pipes, and Monument Valley Park, which has walking and biking paths, an outdoor swimming pool and pickleball courts.

The majority of the trail between Palmer Lake and Fountain is a soft surface breeze gravel trail. A major segment of the trail within the Colorado Springs city limits is paved. The trails, except Monument Valley Park trails, may be used for equestrian traffic. Motorized vehicles are not allowed on the trails. Many of the trails are interconnected, having main spine trails, like the Pikes Peak Greenway, that lead to secondary trails.\nGovernment.\nOn November 2, 2010, Colorado Springs voters adopted a council-strong mayor form of government. The City of Colorado Springs transitioned to the new system of government in 2011. Under the council-strong mayor system of government, the mayor is the chief executive and the city council is the legislative branch. The mayor is a full-time elected position and not a member of the council. The council has nine members, six of whom represent one of six equally populated districts each. The remaining three members are elected at-large.\nColorado Springs City Hall was built from 1902 to 1904 on land donated by W. S. Stratton.\nCity Council.\nThe Colorado Springs City Council consists of nine elected officials, six of whom represent districts and three of whom represent the city at-large.\nPolitics.\nIn 2017 Caleb Hannan wrote in \"Politico\" that Colorado Springs was \"staunchly Republican\", \"a right-wing counterweight to liberal Boulder\", and that a study ranked it \"the fourth most conservative city in America\". In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump's margin of victory in El Paso County was 22 points. That year Hannan wrote that downtown Colorado Springs had a different political vibe from the overall area's and that there were \"superficial signs of changing demographics\". In 2020 the shift toward the political center continued as the incumbent Republican, Donald Trump, edged out Democrat Joe Biden by only 10.8% in El Paso County.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary education.\nIn addition the state of Colorado runs the Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind, a residential school for people up to age 21 and established in 1874, in the city.\nHigher education.\nState institutions offering bachelors and graduate degree programs in Colorado Springs include University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) with more than 12,000 students, and, Pikes Peak State College which offers mostly two-year degree associate degrees.

US 85 and SH 115 are concurrent between Lake Avenue and I-25. US 85 enters the city at Fountain and was signed at Venetucci Blvd, Lake Avenue, and Nevada Avenue at various points in history; however most of US 85 is concurrent with I-25 and is not signed. \nCounty and city roads.\nIn November 2015, voters in Colorado Springs overwhelmingly passed ballot measure 2C, dedicating funds from a temporary sales tax increase to much needed road and infrastructure improvements over five years. This temporary increase is estimated to bring in approximately $50 million annually, which will be used solely to improve roads and infrastructure. The ballot measure passed by a margin of approximately 65\u201335%.\nIn 2004, the voters of Colorado Springs and El Paso County established the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority. \nIn early 2010, the city of Colorado Springs approved an expansion of the northernmost part of Powers Boulevard in order to create an Interstate 25 bypass commonly referred to as the Copper Ridge Expansion.\nAirport.\nColorado Springs Airport (COS; ICAO: KCOS) has been in operation since 1925.

The airport handled 817,000 passengers from October 2020\u2013October 2021, and is served by American, Delta, Southwest, and United.\nBicycling.\nIn April 2018, the Colorado Springs City Council approved a Bike Master Plan. The vision of the city's Bike Master Plan is \"a healthy and vibrant Colorado Springs where bicycling is one of many transportation options for a large portion of the population, and where a well-connected and well-maintained network of urban trails, single-track, and on-street infrastructure offers a bicycling experience for present and future generations that is safe, convenient, and fun for getting around, getting in shape, or getting away.\" Bike lanes in Colorado Springs have not been deployed without controversy. According to \"The Gazette\", their readers \"have mixed feelings for new bike lanes.\" In December 2016, the City removed a bike lane along Research Parkway due to overwhelming opposition; an online survey found that 80.5% of respondents opposed the bike lane. \"The Gazette\" has stated that since the Bike Master Plan was adopted by city council, \"no issue has elicited more argument in \"The Gazette\" pages,\" and due to this immense public interest, on February 25, 2019, \"The Gazette\" hosted a town hall meeting called \"Battle of the Bike Lanes.\"\nWalkability.\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Colorado Springs 34th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.\nMountain Metropolitan Transit.\nMountain Metropolitan Transit (MMT) is testing Battery Electric Buses (BEB), and if the buses perform well, the agency plans to acquire its first three BEBs in 2021 using funds from the Volkswagen emissions scandal and resulting lawsuit and settlement. On April 22, 2022, Mountain Metro unveiled four new all-electric Proterra ZX5 buses to be added to their fleet. The new buses join their current fleet of 67 clean diesel buses. They are funded by the Colorado Department of Transportation Division of Transit and Rail Settlement Transit Bus Replacement Program, Volkswagen Diesel Emission Settlement trust, and Federal transit Administration 5339(b) Buses and Bus Facilities Program grant. The Proterra ZX5 buses run 220 to 330 miles on a single charge, and cost $1.2 million per bus.\nMountain Metro Mobility.\nMountain Metro Mobility is an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) federally mandated complementary ADA paratransit service, which provides demand-response service for individuals with mobility needs that prevent them from using the fixed-route bus system.\nMountain Metro Rides.\nMountain Metro Rides offers alternative transportation options to residents of the Pikes Peak Region. The program is designed to reduce congestion and pollution by encouraging people to commute by carpool, vanpool, bicycling or walking.\nBustang.\nBustang provides intercity transportation to Colorado Springs. It is part of the South and Outrider lines, which connect to Denver and to Lamar. There is an additional line that connects Colorado Springs directly to the Denver Tech Center.\nSister cities.\nColorado Springs' sister cities are:\nColorado Springs's sister city organization began when it became partners with Fujiyoshida. The \"torii\" gate erected to commemorate the relationship stands at the corner of Bijou Street and Nevada Avenue, and is one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. The \"torii\" gate, crisscrossed bridge and shrine, in the median between Platte and Bijou Streets downtown, were a gift to Colorado Springs, erected in 1966 by the Rotary Club of Colorado Springs to celebrate the friendship between the two communities. A plaque near the \"torii\" gate states that \"the purpose of the sister city relationship is to promote understanding between the people of our two countries and cities\". The Fujiyoshida Student exchange program has become an annual event.\nIn 2006 and 2010, the Bankstown TAP (Talent Advancement Program) performed with the Youth Symphony and the Colorado Springs Children's Chorale as part of the annual \"In Harmony\" program. A notable similarity between Colorado Springs and its sister cities is their geographic positions: three of the seven cities are near the foot of a major mountain or mountain range, as is Colorado Springs.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6251", "revid": "6908984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6251", "title": "Professional certification", "text": "Designation earned by a person to assure qualification to perform a job or task\nProfessional certification, trade certification, or professional designation, often called simply \"certification\" or \"qualification\", is a designation earned by a person to assure qualification to perform a job or task. Not all certifications that use post-nominal letters are an acknowledgement of educational achievement, or an agency appointed to safeguard the public interest.\nOverview.\nA certification is a third-party attestation of an individual's level of knowledge or proficiency in a certain industry or profession. They are granted by authorities in the field, such as professional societies and universities, or by private certificate-granting agencies. Most certifications are time-limited; some expire after a period of time (e.g., the lifetime of a product that required certification for use), while others can be renewed indefinitely as long as certain requirements are met. Renewal usually requires ongoing education to remain up-to-date on advancements in the field, evidenced by earning the specified number of continuing education credits (CECs), or continuing education units (CEUs), from approved professional development courses.\nMany certification programs are affiliated with professional associations, trade organizations, or private vendors interested in raising industry standards. Certificate programs are often created or endorsed by professional associations, but are typically completely independent from membership organizations. Certifications are very common in fields such as aviation, construction, technology, environment, and other industrial sectors, as well as healthcare, business, real estate, and finance.\nAccording to \"The Guide to National Professional Certification Programs\" (1997) by Phillip Barnhart, \"certifications are portable, since they do not depend on one company's definition of a certain job\" and they provide potential employers with \"an impartial, third-party endorsement of an individual's professional knowledge and experience\".\nCertification is different from professional licensure. In the United States, licenses are typically issued by state agencies, whereas certifications are usually awarded by professional societies or educational institutes. Obtaining a certificate is voluntary in some fields, but in others, certification from a government-accredited agency may be legally required to perform certain jobs or tasks. In other countries, licenses are typically granted by professional societies or universities and require a certificate after about three to five years and so on thereafter. The assessment process for certification may be more comprehensive than that of licensure, though sometimes the assessment process is very similar or even the same, despite differing in terms of legal status.\nThe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) defines the standard for being a certifying agency as meeting the following two requirements:\nThe Institute for Credentialing Excellence (ICE) is a U.S.-based organization that sets standards for the accreditation of personnel certification and certificate programs based on the \"Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing\", a joint publication of the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the American Psychological Association (APA), and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME). Many members of the Association of Test Publishers (ATP) are also certification organizations.\nCategorization.\nThere are three general types of certification. Listed in order of development level and portability, they are: corporate (internal), product-specific, and profession-wide.\nCorporate, or \"internal\" certifications, are made by a corporation or low-stakes organization for internal purposes. For example, a corporation might require a one-day training course for all sales personnel, after which they receive a certificate. While this certificate has limited portability \u2013 to other corporations, for example \u2013 it is the most simple to develop.\nProduct-specific certifications are more involved, and are intended to be referenced to a product across all applications. This approach is very prevalent in the information technology (IT) industry, where personnel are certified on a version of software or hardware. This type of certification is portable across locations (for example, different corporations that use that software), but not across other products. Another example could be the certifications issued for shipping personnel, which are under international standards even for the recognition of the certification body, under the International Maritime Organization (IMO).\nThe most general type of certification is profession-wide. Certification in the medical profession is often offered by particular specialties. In order to apply professional standards, increase the level of practice, and protect the public, a professional organization might establish a certification. This is intended to be portable to all places a certified professional might work. Of course, this generalization increases the cost of such a program; the process to establish a legally defensible assessment of an entire profession is very extensive. An example of this is a Certified Public Accountant\u00a0(CPA), which would not be certified for just one corporation or one piece of accountancy software but for general work in the profession.\nProfessional certificates awarded by tertiary education providers.\nMany tertiary education providers grant professional certificates as an award for the completion of an educational program. The curriculum of a professional certificate is most often in a focused subject matter. Many professional certificates have the same curriculum as master's degrees in the same subject. Many other professional certificates offer the same courses as master's degrees in the same subject, but require the student to take fewer total courses to complete the program. Some professional certificates have a curriculum that more closely resembles a baccalaureate major in the same field. The typical professional certificate program is between 200 and 300 class-hours in size. It is uncommon for a program to be larger or smaller than that. Most professional certificate programs are open enrollment, but some have admissions processes. A few universities put some of their professional certificates into a subclass they refer to as advanced professional certificates.\nSome of the more commonly offered professional certificates include:\nAdvanced professional certificate.\n\"Advanced professional certificates\" are professional credentials designed to help professionals enhance their job performance and marketability in their respective fields. In many other countries, certificates are qualifications in higher education. In the United States, a certificate may be offered by an institute of higher education. These certificates usually signify that a student has reached a standard of knowledge of a certain vocational subject. Certificate programs can be completed more quickly than associate degrees and often do not have general education requirements.\nAn advanced professional certificate is a result of an educational process designed for individuals. Certificates are designed for both newcomers to the industry as well as seasoned professionals. Certificates are awarded by an educational program or academic institution. Completion of a certificate program indicates completion of a course or series of courses with a specific concentration that is different from an educational degree program. Course content for an advanced certificate is set forth through a variety of sources i.e. faculty, committee, instructors, and other subject matter experts in a related field. The end goal of an advanced professional certificate is so that professionals may demonstrate knowledge of course content at the end of a set period in time.\nAreas of certification.\nAccountancy, auditing and finance.\nThere are many professional bodies for accountants and auditors throughout the world; some of them are legally recognized in their jurisdictions.\nPublic accountants are the accountancy and control experts that are legally certified in different jurisdictions to work in public practices, certifying accounts as statutory auditors, eventually selling advice and services to other individuals and businesses. Today, however, many work within private corporations, financial industry, and government bodies.\nAccounting and external auditing.\nCf. Accountancy qualifications and regulation\nAviation.\nAviators are certified through theoretical and in-flight examinations. Requirements for certifications are quite equal in most countries and are regulated by each National Aviation Authority. The existing certificates or pilot licenses are:\nLicensing in these categories require not only examinations but also a minimum number of flight hours. All categories are available for Fixed-Wing Aircraft (airplanes) and Rotatory-Wing Aircraft (helicopters). Within each category, aviators may also obtain certifications in:\nUsually, aviators must be certified also in their log books for the type and model of aircraft they are allowed to fly. Currency checks as well as regular medical check-ups with a frequency of 6 months, 12 months, or 36 months, depending on the type of flying permitted, are obligatory. An aviator can fly only if holding:\nIn Europe, the ANSP, ATCO &amp; ANSP technicians are certified according to EUROCONTROL Safety Regulatory Requirement (ESARRs) (according to EU regulation 2096/2005 \"Common Requirements\").\nCommunications.\nIn the United States, several communications certifications are conferred by the Electronics Technicians Association.\nComputer technology.\nCertification is often used in the professions of software engineering and information technology.\nDance.\nConferred by the\u00a0International Dance Council CID\u00a0at\u00a0UNESCO, the International Certification of Dance Studies is awarded to students who have completed 150 hours of classes in a specific form of dance for Level 1. Another 150 hours are required for Level 2 and so on till Level 10. This is the only international certification for dance since the\u00a0International Dance Council CID\u00a0is the official body for all forms of dance; it is usually given in addition to local or national certificates, that is why it is colloquially called \"the dancer's passport\". Students cannot apply for this certification directly \u2013 they have to ask their school to apply on their behalf. This certification is awarded free of charge, there is no cost other than membership fees.\nInternational Dance Council CID\u00a0at\u00a0UNESCO\u00a0administers the\u00a0International Certification of Dance Studies.\nElectronics.\nIn the United States, several electronics certifications are provided by the Electronics Technicians Association.\nEmergency management.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency's EMI offers credentials and training opportunities for United States citizens. Students do not have to be employed by FEMA or be federal employees for some of the programs.\nEngineering.\nProfessional engineering is any act of planning, designing, composing, measuring, evaluating, inspecting, advising, reporting, directing or supervising, or managing any of the foregoing, that requires the application of engineering principles and that concerns the safeguarding of life, health, property, economic interests, the public interest or the environment.\nEvent planning.\nEvent planning includes budgeting, scheduling, site selection, acquiring necessary permits, coordinating transportation and parking, arranging for speakers or entertainers, arranging decor, event security, catering, coordinating with third-party vendors, and emergency plans.\nCommon event planning certifications include:\nFacility management.\nFacility management can be defined as an aspect of engineering management science that deals with the planning, designing, coordination of space and maintenance of a built environment to enhance quality service management system. Service Quality System includes activities like security, maintenance, catering, and external as well as internal cleaning. In general, it is also the coordination and harmonization of various specialist disciplines to create the best possible working environment for staff.\nFacility management is an interdisciplinary field devoted to the coordination of space, infrastructure, people and organization, often associated with the administration of office blocks, arenas, schools, convention centers, shopping complexes, hospitals, hotels, etc. However, FM facilitates on a wider range of activities than just business services and these are referred to as non-core functions.\nWarehousing management.\nA warehouse management system (WMS) is a part of the supply chain and primarily aims to control the movement and storage of materials within a warehouse and process the associated transactions, including shipping, receiving, putaway and picking. The systems also direct and optimize stock putaway based on real-time information about the status of bin utilization. A WMS monitors the progress of products through the warehouse. It involves the physical warehouse infrastructure, tracking systems, and communication between product stations.\nMore precisely, warehouse management involves the receipt, storage and movement of goods, (normally finished goods), to intermediate storage locations or to a final customer. In the multi-echelon model for distribution, there may be multiple levels of warehouses. This includes a central warehouse, a regional warehouses (serviced by the central warehouse) and potentially retail warehouses (serviced by the regional warehouses).\nExplosive atmospheres.\nIECEx covers the specialized field of explosion protection associated with the use of equipment in areas where flammable gases, liquids and combustible dusts may be present. This system provides the assurance that equipment is manufactured to meet safety standards, and that services such as installation, repair and overhaul also comply with IEC International Standards on 60079 series. The UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe), cited IECEx as one example of a practice model for the verification of conformity to IEC Standards, for European smaller countries with no certification schemes for such equipment. It published a \"Common Regulatory Framework\" as a suggestion for those countries implementing a certification program for the explosive atmospheres' segment.\nInsurance and risk management.\nIn the United States, insurance professionals are licensed separately by each state. Many individuals seek one or more certifications to distinguish themselves from their peers.\nLanguage education.\nTESOL is a large field of employment with widely varying degrees of regulation. Most provision worldwide is through the state school system of each individual country, and as such, the instructors tend to be trained primary- or secondary school teachers who are native speakers of the language of their pupils, and not of English. Though native speakers of English have been working in non-English speaking countries in this capacity for years, it was not until the last twenty-five years or so that there was any widespread focus on training particularly for this field. Previously, workers in this sort of job were people engaging in backpacker tourism hoping to earn some extra travel money or well-educated professionals in other fields volunteering, or retired people. These sort of people are certainly still to be found, but there are many who consider TESOL their main profession.\nOne of the problems facing these full-time teachers is the absence of an international governing body for the certification or licensure of English language teachers. However, Cambridge University and its subsidiary body UCLES are pioneers in trying to get some degree of accountability and quality control to consumers of English courses, through their CELTA and DELTA programs. Trinity College London has equivalent programs, the CertTESOL and the LTCL DipTESOL. They offer initial certificates in teaching, in which candidates are trained in language awareness and classroom techniques, and given a chance to practice teaching, after which feedback is reported. Both institutions have as a follow-up a professional diploma, usually taken after a year or two in the field. Although the initial certificate is available to anyone with a high school education, the diploma is meant to be a post-graduate qualification and can in fact be incorporated into a master's degree program.\nLegal affairs.\nAn increasing number of attorneys are choosing to be recognized as having special expertise in certain fields of law. According to the American Bar Association, a lawyer who is a certified specialist has been recognized by an independent professional certifying organization as having an enhanced level of skill and expertise, as well as substantial involvement in an established legal specialty. These organizations require a lawyer to demonstrate special training, experience and knowledge to ensure that the lawyer's recognition is meaningful and reliable. Lawyer conduct with regard to specialty certification is regulated by the states.\nLegal administrators vary in their day-to-day responsibilities and job requirements. The Association of Legal Administrators (ALA) is the credentialing body of the Certified Legal Manager (CLM) certification program. CLMs are recognized as administrators who have passed a comprehensive examination and have met other eligibility requirements.:\nLibrarians.\nIn Australia, ALIA (Australian Library and Information Association) certifies librarians and library technicians. Distinguished librarians who have completed a high level of professional learning are awarded the Distinguished Certified Professional Award. Prior to 2013, this award was known as Associate Fellows.\nIn New Zealand, the accrediting body is LIANZA (Library and Information Association of New Zealand Aotearoa Te Rau Herenga O Aotearoa). LIANZA accredit prominent librarians at three levels, Fellows, Life Members and Associates.\nLogistics and transport.\nLogistician is the profession in the logistics and transport sectors, including sea, air, land and rail modes. Professional qualification for logisticians usually carries post-nominal letters.\nCertification granting bodies include, but are not limited to, Institute for Supply Management (ISM), Association for Operations Management (APICS), Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT), International Society of Logistics (SOLE), Canadian Institute of Traffic and Transportation (CITT), and Allied Council for Commerce and Logistics (ACCL).\nManagement Consulting.\nManagement consulting is the practice of providing consulting services to organizations to improve their performance or in any way to assist in achieving any sort of organizational objectives.\nThe profession's primary certification is the \"Certified Management Consultant\" (CMC) designation.\nCertification granting bodies are the approximately 50 Institutes of Management Consulting belonging to the International Council of Management Consulting Institutes (ICMCI). \nMinisters.\nChurches have their own process of who may use various religious titles. Protestant churches typically require a Masters of Divinity, accreditation by the denomination and ordination by the local church in order for a minister to become a \"Reverend\". Those qualifications may or may not also give government authorization to solemnize marriages.\nMedicine.\nBoard certification is the process by which a physician in the United States documents by written, practical or computer based testing, illustrating a mastery of knowledge and skills that define a particular area of medical specialization. The American Board of Medical Specialties, a not-for-profit organization, assists 24 approved medical specialty boards in the development and use of standards in the ongoing evaluation and certification of physicians.\nMedical specialty certification in the United States is a voluntary process. While medical licensure sets the minimum competency requirements to diagnose and treat patients, it is not specialty specific. Board certification demonstrates a physician's exceptional expertise in a particular specialty or sub-specialty of medical practice.\nPatients, physicians, health care providers, insurers and quality organizations regard certification as an important measure of a physician's knowledge, experience and skills to provide quality health care within a given specialty.\nOther professional certifications include certifications such as medical licenses, Membership of the Royal College of Physicians, Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, nursing board certification, diplomas in social work. The Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy certifies pharmacists that are knowledgeable about principles of geriatric pharmacotherapy and the provision of pharmaceutical care to the elderly. Additional certifying bodies relating to the medical field include:\nPeer support.\nNCPRP stands for \"National Certified Peer Recovery Professional\", and the NCPRP credential and exam were developed in collaboration with the International Certification Board of Recovery Professionals (ICBRP) and is currently being administered by PARfessionals.\nPARfessionals is a professional organization and all of the available courses are professional development and pre-certification courses.\nThe NCPRP credential and exam focus primarily on the concept of peer recovery through mental health and addiction recovery. It has the main purpose of training student-candidates on how to become peer recovery professionals who can provide guidance, knowledge or assistance for individuals who have had similar experiences.\nEach student-candidate must complete several key steps which include initial registration; the pre-certification review course; and all applicable sections of the official application in order to become eligible to complete the final step, which is the NCPRP certification exam.\nThe NCPRP credential is obtained once a participant successfully passes the NCPRP certification exam by the second attempt and is valid for five years.\nProject management.\nOrganizations that offer various certifications include:\nPublic health.\nNational Board of Public Health Examiners, www.nbphe.org\nPublic relations.\nIn the US, the Universal Accreditation Board, an organization composed of the Public Relations Society of America, the Agricultural Relations Council, the National School Public Relations Association, the Religious Communicators Council and other public relations professional societies, administers the Accreditation in Public Relations (APR), a voluntary certification program for public relations practitioners.\nPublic Participation.\nThe Certified Public Participation Professional (CP3) and Master Certified Public Participation Professional (MCP3) are awarded by two regions of the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) : IAP2 Canada and IAP2 USA. As of 2019, only 25 individuals had achieved either of these distinctions. The CP3 designation is awarded upon successfully completing a three-step process that includes a written application documenting the individual's experience in the profession, a written response to a case study, and an in-person oral assessment.\nIndividuals seeking certification are assessed against 5 Core Competencies, which are the essential capabilities for a professional in this field to effectively design, implement, and evaluate public participation programs. The competencies emerged from qualitative analysis of a comprehensive list of knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, skills, behaviors, and capabilities identified in June 2014 by more than 100 P2 professionals from around the world. The descriptions and quality standards for each competency were developed, tested, and refined through an iterative process involving IAP2 members.

Menger contributed to the development of the theories of marginalism and marginal utility, which rejected cost-of-production theory of value, such as developed by the classical economists such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo. As a departure from such, he would go on to call his resultant perspective, the subjective theory of value.\nBiography.\nFamily and education.\nCarl Menger von Wolfensgr\u00fcn was born in the city of Neu-Sandez in Galicia, Austrian Empire, which is now Nowy S\u0105cz in Poland. He was the son of a wealthy family of minor nobility; his father, Anton Menger, was a lawyer. His mother, Caroline Ger\u017cabek, was the daughter of a wealthy Bohemian merchant. He had two brothers, Anton and Max, both prominent as lawyers. His son, Karl Menger, was a mathematician who taught for many years at Illinois Institute of Technology.\nAfter attending \"gymnasium\" he studied law at the Universities of Prague and Vienna and later received a doctorate in jurisprudence from the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w. In the 1860s Menger left school and enjoyed a stint as a journalist reporting and analyzing market news, first at the \"Lemberger Zeitung\" in Lemberg, Austrian Galicia (now Lviv, Ukraine) and later at the in Vienna.\nCareer.\nDuring the course of his newspaper work, he noticed a discrepancy between what the classical economics he was taught in school said about price determination and what real world market participants believed. In 1867 Menger began a study of political economy which culminated in 1871 with the publication of his \"Principles of Economics\" \"(\"\"),\" thus becoming the father of the Austrian School of economic thought. It was in this work that he challenged classical cost-based theories of value with his theory of marginality \u2013 that price is determined at the margin.\nIn 1872 Menger was enrolled into the law faculty at the University of Vienna and spent the next several years teaching finance and political economy both in seminars and lectures to a growing number of students. In 1873, he received the university's chair of economic theory at the very young age of 33.\nIn 1876 Menger began tutoring Archduke Rudolf von Habsburg, the Crown Prince of Austria in political economy and statistics. For two years, Menger accompanied the prince during his travels, first through continental Europe and then later through the British Isles. He is also thought to have assisted the crown prince in the composition of a pamphlet, published anonymously in 1878, which was highly critical of the higher Austrian aristocracy. His association with the prince would last until Rudolf's suicide in 1889.\nIn 1878 Rudolf's father, Emperor Franz Joseph, appointed Menger to the chair of political economy at Vienna. The title of \"Hofrat\" was conferred on him, and he was appointed to the Austrian in 1900.\nDispute with the historical school.\nEnsconced in his professorship, he set about refining and defending the positions he took and methods he utilized in \"Principles,\" the result of which was the 1883 publication of \"Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics (\"\").\" The book caused a firestorm of debate, during which members of the historical school of economics began to derisively call Menger and his students the \"Austrian School\" to emphasize their departure from mainstream German economic thought \u2013 the term was specifically used in an unfavorable review by Gustav von Schmoller.\nIn 1884 Menger responded with the pamphlet \"The Errors of Historicism in German Economics\" and launched the infamous \",\" or methodological debate, between the Historical School and the Austrian School. During this time Menger began to attract like-minded disciples who would go on to make their own mark on the field of economics, most notably Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, and Friedrich von Wieser.\nIn the late 1880s, Menger was appointed to head a commission to reform the Austrian monetary system. Over the course of the next decade, he authored a plethora of articles which would revolutionize monetary theory, including \"The Theory of Capital\" (1888) and \"Money\" (1892). Largely due to his pessimism about the state of German scholarship, Menger resigned his professorship in 1903 to concentrate on study.\nPhilosophical influences.\nThere are different opinions on Menger's philosophical influences. But it is without discussion that there is a rudimentary dispute of Menger with Plato and a very meticulous one with Aristotle, especially with his ethics.\n\"Plato holds that money is an agreed sign for change and Aristotle says, that money came into being as an agreement, not by nature, but by law.\"\nAlso, the influence of Kant is provable. Many authors emphasize also rationalism and idealism, as is represented by Christian Wolff. Looking at the literature, most writers think that Menger represents an essential Aristotelian position. This is surprisingly a position that is contrary to his theory of the subjective value and his individualistic methodological position.\nAnother entry is the use of deduction or induction. \u00a0With his price theory can be shown that Menger is nominalistic and, stronger, anti-essentialistic. That is to say that his approach is inductionalistic.\nEconomics.\nMenger used his subjective theory of value to arrive at what he considered one of the most powerful insights in economics: \"both sides gain from exchange\". Unlike William Jevons, Menger did not believe that goods provide \"utils,\" or units of utility. Rather, he wrote, goods are valuable because they serve various uses whose importance differs. Menger also came up with an explanation of how money develops that is still accepted by some schools of thought today.\nMoney.\nMenger believed that gold and silver were the precious metals that were adopted as money for their unique attributes like costliness, durability, and easy preservation, making them the \"most popular vehicle for hoarding as well as the goods most highly favoured in commerce.\" Menger showed that \"their special saleableness\" tended to make their bid-ask spread tighter than any other market good, which led to their adoption as a general medium of exchange and evolution in many societies as money.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "6258", "revid": "6036800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6258", "title": "Civilization", "text": "Stratified complex society\nA civilization (British English: \"civilisation\") is any complex society characterized by the development of the state, social stratification, urbanization, and symbolic systems of communication beyond natural spoken language (namely, a writing system).\nCivilizations are additionally characterized by other features, including agriculture, architecture, infrastructure, technological advancement, taxation, regulation, and specialization of labour.\nHistorically, a civilization has often been understood as a larger and \"more advanced\" culture, in implied contrast to smaller, supposedly less advanced cultures. In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of nomadic pastoralists, Neolithic societies, or hunter-gatherers; however, sometimes it also contrasts with the cultures found within civilizations themselves. Civilizations are organized densely-populated settlements divided into hierarchical social classes with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.\nThe word \u201ccivilization\u201d relates to the Latin word \u201ccivitas\u201d or \u201ccity.\u201d This is why the most basic definition of the word \u201ccivilization\u201d is \u201ca society made up of cities.\u201d\nThe earliest emergence of civilizations is generally connected with the final stages of the Neolithic Revolution in West Asia, culminating in the relatively rapid process of urban revolution and state formation, a political development associated with the appearance of a governing elite.\nHistory of the concept.\nThe English word \"civilization\" comes from the 16th-century French \"civilis\u00e9\" (\"civilized\"), from Latin \"civilis\" (\"civil\"), related to \"civis\" (\"citizen\") and \"civitas\" (\"city\"). The fundamental treatise is Norbert Elias's \"The Civilizing Process\" (1939), which traces social mores from medieval courtly society to the Early Modern period. In \"The Philosophy of Civilization\" (1923), Albert Schweitzer outlines two opinions: one purely material and the other material and ethical. He said that the world crisis was from humanity losing the ethical idea of civilization, \"the sum total of all progress made by man in every sphere of action and from every point of view in so far as the progress helps towards the spiritual perfecting of individuals as the progress of all progress\".\nRelated words like \"civility\" developed in the mid-16th century. The abstract noun \"civilization\", meaning \"civilized condition\", came in the 1760s, again from French. The first known use in French is in 1757, by Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau, and the first use in English is attributed to Adam Ferguson, who in his 1767 \"Essay on the History of Civil Society\" wrote, \"Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood but the species itself from rudeness to civilisation\". The word was therefore opposed to barbarism or rudeness, in the active pursuit of progress characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment.\nIn the late 1700s and early 1800s, during the French Revolution, \"civilization\" was used in the singular, never in the plural, and meant the progress of humanity as a whole. This is still the case in French. The use of \"civilizations\" as a countable noun was in occasional use in the 19th century, but has become much more common in the later 20th century, sometimes just meaning culture (itself in origin an uncountable noun, made countable in the context of ethnography). Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a \"medieval civilization\", which in Elias's sense would have been an oxymoron.\nAlready in the 18th century, civilization was not always seen as an improvement. One historically important distinction between culture and civilization is from the writings of Rousseau, particularly his work about education, \"\". Here, civilization, being more rational and socially driven, is not fully in accord with human nature, and \"human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original discursive or prerational natural unity\" (see noble savage). From this, a new approach was developed, especially in Germany, first by Johann Gottfried Herder and later by philosophers such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. This sees cultures as natural organisms, not defined by \"conscious, rational, deliberative acts\", but a kind of pre-rational \"folk spirit\". Civilization, in contrast, though more rational and more successful in material progress, is unnatural and leads to \"vices of social life\" such as guile, hypocrisy, envy and avarice. In World War II, Leo Strauss, having fled Germany, argued in New York that this opinion of civilization was behind Nazism and German militarism and nihilism.\nCharacteristics.\nSocial scientists such as V. Gordon Childe have named a number of traits that distinguish a civilization from other kinds of society. Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of livelihood, settlement patterns, forms of government, social stratification, economic systems, literacy and other cultural traits. Andrew Nikiforuk argues that \"civilizations relied on shackled human muscle. It took the energy of slaves to plant crops, clothe emperors, and build cities\" and considers slavery to be a common feature of pre-modern civilizations.\nAll civilizations have depended on agriculture for subsistence, with the possible exception of some early civilizations in Peru which may have depended upon maritime resources. \nThe traditional \"surplus model\" postulates that cereal farming results in accumulated storage and a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial fertilization, irrigation and crop rotation. It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare. Grain surpluses have been especially important because grain can be stored for a long time.\nResearch from the \"Journal of Political Economy\" contradicts the surplus model. It postulates that horticultural gardening was more productive than cereal farming. However, only cereal farming produced civilization because of the appropriability of yearly harvest. Rural populations that could only grow cereals could be taxed allowing for a taxing elite and urban development. This also had a negative effect on rural population, increasing relative agricultural output per farmer. Farming efficiency created food surplus and sustained the food surplus through decreasing rural population growth in favour of urban growth. Suitability of highly productive roots and tubers was in fact a curse of plenty, which prevented the emergence of states and impeded economic development. \nA surplus of food permits some people to do things besides producing food for a living: early civilizations included soldiers, artisans, priests and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and perhaps during the Mesolithic Natufian culture. It is possible that food surpluses and relatively large scale social organization and division of labour predates plant and animal domestication.\nCivilizations have distinctly different settlement patterns from other societies. The word \"civilization\" is sometimes defined as \"\"'living in cities\"'\". Non-farmers tend to gather in cities to work and to trade.\nCompared with other societies, civilizations have a more complex political structure, namely the state. State societies are more stratified\n than other societies; there is a greater difference among the social classes. The ruling class, normally concentrated in the cities, has control over much of the surplus and exercises its will through the actions of a government or bureaucracy. Morton Fried, a conflict theorist and Elman Service, an integration theorist, have classified human cultures based on political systems and social inequality. This system of classification contains four categories\nEconomically, civilizations display more complex patterns of ownership and exchange than less organized societies. Living in one place allows people to accumulate more personal possessions than nomadic people. Some people also acquire landed property, or private ownership of the land. Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their own food, they must trade their goods and services for food in a market system, or receive food through the levy of tribute, redistributive taxation, tariffs or tithes from the food producing segment of the population. Early human cultures functioned through a gift economy supplemented by limited barter systems. By the early Iron Age, contemporary civilizations developed money as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions. In a village, the potter makes a pot for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a certain amount of beer. In a city, the potter may need a new roof, the roofer may need new shoes, the cobbler may need new horseshoes, the blacksmith may need a new coat and the tanner may need a new pot. These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time. A monetary system is a way of organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled. From the days of the earliest monetarized civilizations, monopolistic controls of monetary systems have benefited the social and political elites.\nThe transition from simpler to more complex economies does not necessarily mean an improvement in the living standards of the populace. For example, although the Middle Ages is often portrayed as an era of decline from the Roman Empire, studies have shown that the average stature of males in the Middle Ages (c. 500 to 1500 CE) was greater than it was for males during the preceding Roman Empire and the succeeding Early Modern Period (c. 1500 to 1800 CE). Also, the Plains Indians of North America in the 19th century were taller than their \"civilized\" American and European counterparts. The average stature of a population is a good measurement of the adequacy of its access to necessities, especially food, and its freedom from disease. \nWriting, developed first by people in Sumer, is considered a hallmark of civilization and \"appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state\". Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records. Like money, the writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other. However, writing is not always necessary for civilization, as shown by the Inca civilization of the Andes, which did not use writing at all but except for a complex recording system consisting of knotted strings of different lengths and colors: the \"Quipus\", and still functioned as a civilized society.\nAided by their division of labour and central government planning, civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits. These include organized religion, development in the arts, and countless new advances in science and technology.\nThroughout history, successful civilizations have spread, taking over more and more territory, and assimilating more and more previously uncivilized people. Nevertheless, some tribes or people remain uncivilized even to this day. These cultures are called by some \"primitive\", a term that is regarded by others as pejorative. \"Primitive\" implies in some way that a culture is \"first\" (Latin = \"primus\"), that it has not changed since the dawn of humanity, though this has been demonstrated not to be true. Specifically, as all of today's cultures are contemporaries, today's so-called primitive cultures are in no way antecedent to those we consider civilized. Anthropologists today use the term \"non-literate\" to describe these peoples.\nCivilization has been spread by colonization, invasion, religious conversion, the extension of bureaucratic control and trade, and by introducing agriculture and writing to non-literate peoples. Some non-civilized people may willingly adapt to civilized behaviour. But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders.\nAssessments of what level of civilization a polity has reached are based on comparisons of the relative importance of agricultural as opposed to trading or manufacturing capacities, the territorial extensions of its power, the complexity of its division of labour, and the carrying capacity of its urban centres. Secondary elements include a developed transportation system, writing, standardized measurement, currency, contractual and tort-based legal systems, art, architecture, mathematics, scientific understanding, metallurgy, political structures, and organized religion.\nTraditionally, polities that managed to achieve notable military, ideological and economic power defined themselves as \"civilized\" as opposed to other societies or human groupings outside their sphere of influence\u00a0\u2013 calling the latter barbarians, savages, and primitives.\nCultural identity.\n\"Civilization\" can also refer to the culture of a complex society, not just the society itself. Every society, civilization or not, has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique. Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a state-based decision-making apparatus, a literature, professional art, architecture, organized religion and complex customs of education, coercion and control associated with maintaining the elite.\nThe intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to spread to and influence other cultures, sometimes assimilating them into the civilization (a classic example being Chinese civilization and its influence on nearby civilizations such as Korea, Japan and Vietnam). Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres containing many nations and regions. The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.\nIt is precisely the protection of this cultural identity that is becoming increasingly important nationally and internationally. According to international law, the United Nations and UNESCO try to set up and enforce relevant rules. The aim is to preserve the cultural heritage of humanity and also the cultural identity, especially in the case of war and armed conflict. According to Karl von Habsburg, President of Blue Shield International, the destruction of cultural assets is also part of psychological warfare. The target of the attack is often the opponent's cultural identity, which is why symbolic cultural assets become a main target. It is also intended to destroy the particularly sensitive cultural memory (museums, archives, monuments, etc.), the grown cultural diversity, and the economic basis (such as tourism) of a state, region or community.\nMany historians have focused on these broad cultural spheres and have treated civilizations as discrete units. Early twentieth-century philosopher Oswald Spengler, uses the German word \"Kultur\", \"culture\", for what many call a \"civilization\". Spengler believed a civilization's coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol. Cultures experience cycles of birth, life, decline, and death, often supplanted by a potent new culture, formed around a compelling new cultural symbol. Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the decline of a culture as \"the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable\".\nThis \"unified culture\" concept of civilization also influenced the theories of historian Arnold J. Toynbee in the mid-twentieth century. Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multi-volume \"A Study of History\", which traced the rise and, in most cases, the decline of 21 civilizations and five \"arrested civilizations\". Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a \"creative minority\", through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes.\nSamuel P. Huntington defines civilization as \"the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species\".\nComplex systems.\nAnother group of theorists, making use of systems theory, looks at a civilization as a complex system, i.e., a framework by which a group of objects can be analysed that work in concert to produce some result. Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them. Any organization is a complex social system and a civilization is a large organization. Systems theory helps guard against superficial and misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations.\nSystems theorists look at many types of relations between cities, including economic relations, cultural exchanges and political/diplomatic/military relations. These spheres often occur on different scales. For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres. Extensive trade routes, including the Silk Road through Central Asia and Indian Ocean sea routes linking the Roman Empire, Persian Empire, India and China, were well established 2000 years ago when these civilizations scarcely shared any political, diplomatic, military, or cultural relations. The first evidence of such long-distance trade is in the ancient world. During the Uruk period, Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan. Resin found later in the Royal Cemetery at Ur is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique.\nMany theorists argue that the entire world has already become integrated into a single \"world system\", a process known as globalization. Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways. There is debate over when this integration began, and what sort of integration \u2013 cultural, technological, economic, political, or military-diplomatic \u2013 is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization. David Wilkinson has proposed that economic and military-diplomatic integration of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the \"Central Civilization\" around 1500 BCE. Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century. According to Wilkinson, civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous, like the Central Civilization, or homogeneous, like the Japanese civilization. What Huntington calls the \"clash of civilizations\" might be characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a single global civilization. Others point to the Crusading movement as the first step in globalization. The more conventional viewpoint is that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since ancient times, and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product of recent European colonialism.\nHistory.\nThe notion of human history as a succession of \"civilizations\" is an entirely modern one. In the European Age of Discovery, emerging Modernity was put into stark contrast with the Neolithic and Mesolithic stage of the cultures of many of the peoples they encountered.\nUrban Revolution.\nAt first, the Neolithic was associated with shifting subsistence cultivation, where continuous farming led to the depletion of soil fertility resulting in the requirement to cultivate fields further and further removed from settlements, eventually compelling the settlements themselves to move. In major semi-arid river valleys, annual flooding renewed soil fertility every year, with the result that population densities there could rise significantly.\nThis encouraged a secondary products revolution in which people used domesticated animals not just for meat, but also for milk, wool, manure and pulling ploughs and carts\u00a0\u2013 a development that spread through the Eurasian Oecumene.\nThe Natufian culture in the Levantine corridor provides the earliest case of a Neolithic Revolution, with the planting of cereal crops attested from c. 11,000 BCE. The earliest neolithic technology and lifestyle were established first in Western Asia (for example at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, from about 9,130 BCE), later in the Yellow River and Yangtze basins in China (for example the Peiligang and Pengtoushan cultures), and from these cores spread across Eurasia. Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest civilizations developing from 7,400 years ago. This area has been evaluated by Beverley Milton-Edwards as having \"inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel, the building of the earliest cities and the development of written cursive script\".\nSimilar pre-civilized \"neolithic revolutions\" also began independently from 7,000 BCE in northwestern South America (the Norte Chico civilization) and in Mesoamerica. The Black Sea area served as a cradle of European civilization. The site of Solnitsata \u2013 a prehistoric fortified ( walled) stone settlement (prehistoric city) (5500\u20134200 BCE) \u2013 is believed by some archeologists to be the oldest known town in present-day Europe.\nThe 8.2 Kiloyear Arid Event and the 5.9 Kiloyear Interpluvial saw the drying out of semiarid regions and a major spread of deserts. This climate change shifted the cost-benefit ratio of endemic violence between communities, which saw the abandonment of unwalled village communities and the appearance of walled cities, seen by some as a characteristic of early civilizations.\nThis \"urban revolution\" (V. Gordon Childe introduced this term in the 1930s) from the 4th millennium BCE\nmarked the beginning of the accumulation of transferable surpluses, which helped economies and cities develop. Urban revolutions were associated with the state monopoly of violence, the appearance of a soldier class and endemic warfare, the rapid development of hierarchies, and the use of human sacrifice.\nThe civilized urban revolution in turn was dependent upon the development of sedentism, the domestication of grains, plants and animals, the permanence of settlements and development of lifestyles that facilitated economies of scale and accumulation of surplus production by certain social sectors. The transition from \"complex cultures\" to \"civilizations\", while still disputed, seems to be associated with the development of state structures, in which power was further monopolized by an \u00e9lite ruling class who practiced human sacrifice.\nTowards the end of the Neolithic period, various elitist Chalcolithic civilizations began to rise in various \"cradles\" from around 3600 BCE beginning with Mesopotamia, expanding into large-scale kingdoms and empires in the course of the Bronze Age (Akkadian Empire, Indus Valley Civilization, Old Kingdom of Egypt, Neo-Sumerian Empire, Middle Assyrian Empire, Babylonian Empire, Hittite Empire, and to some degree the territorial expansions of the Elamites, Hurrians, Amorites and Ebla).\nOutside the Old World, a later development took place independently in the Pre-Columbian Americas. Urbanization in the Norte Chico civilization in coastal Peru emerged about 3200 BCE; the oldest known Mayan city, located in Guatemala, dates to about 750 BCE. and Teotihuacan in Mexico was one of the largest cities in the world in 350 CE, with a population of about 125,000.\nAxial Age.\nThe Bronze Age collapse was followed by the Iron Age around 1200 BCE, during which a number of new civilizations emerged, culminating in a period from the 8th to the 3rd century BCE which Karl Jaspers termed the Axial Age, presented as a critical transitional phase leading to classical civilization.\nModernity.\nA major technological and cultural transition to modernity began approximately 1500 CE in Western Europe, and from this beginning new approaches to science and law spread rapidly around the world, incorporating earlier cultures into the technological and industrial society of the present.\nFall of civilizations.\nCivilizations are traditionally understood as ending in one of two ways; either through incorporation into another expanding civilization (e.g. as Ancient Egypt was incorporated into Hellenistic Greek, and subsequently Roman civilizations), or by collapsing and reverting to a simpler form of living, as happens in so-called Dark Ages.\nThere have been many explanations put forward for the collapse of civilization. Some focus on historical examples, and others on general theory.\nFuture.\nPolitical scientist Samuel Huntington has argued that the defining characteristic of the 21st century will be a clash of civilizations. According to Huntington, conflicts between civilizations will supplant the conflicts between nation-states and ideologies that characterized the 19th and 20th centuries. These views have been strongly challenged by others like Edward Said, Muhammed Asadi and Amartya Sen. Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris have argued that the \"true clash of civilizations\" between the Muslim world and the West is caused by the Muslim rejection of the West's more liberal sexual values, rather than a difference in political ideology, although they note that this lack of tolerance is likely to lead to an eventual rejection of (true) democracy. In \"Identity and Violence\" Sen questions if people should be divided along the lines of a supposed \"civilization\", defined by religion and culture only. He argues that this ignores the many others identities that make up people and leads to a focus on differences.\nCultural Historian Morris Berman argues in \"Dark Ages America: the End of Empire\" that in the corporate consumerist United States, the very factors that once propelled it to greatness\u2015extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth\u2015have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where collapse is inevitable. Politically associated with over-reach, and as a result of the environmental exhaustion and polarization of wealth between rich and poor, he concludes the current system is fast arriving at a situation where continuation of the existing system saddled with huge deficits and a hollowed-out economy is physically, socially, economically and politically impossible. Although developed in much more depth, Berman's thesis is similar in some ways to that of Urban Planner, Jane Jacobs who argues that the five pillars of United States culture are in serious decay: community and family; higher education; the effective practice of science; taxation and government; and the self-regulation of the learned professions. The corrosion of these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor.\nCultural critic and author Derrick Jensen argues that modern civilization is directed towards the domination of the environment and humanity itself in an intrinsically harmful, unsustainable, and self-destructive fashion. Defending his definition both linguistically and historically, he defines civilization as \"a culture... that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities\", with \"cities\" defined as \"people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life\". This need for civilizations to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources. Therefore, civilizations inherently adopt imperialist and expansionist policies and, to maintain these, highly militarized, hierarchically structured, and coercion-based cultures and lifestyles.\nThe Kardashev scale classifies civilizations based on their level of technological advancement, specifically measured by the amount of energy a civilization is able to harness. The scale is only hypothetical, but it puts energy consumption in a cosmic perspective. The Kardashev scale makes provisions for civilizations far more technologically advanced than any currently known to exist.\nNon-human civilizations.\nThe current scientific consensus is that human beings are the only animal species with the cognitive ability to create civilizations that has emerged on Earth. A recent thought experiment, the silurian hypothesis, however, considers whether it would \"be possible to detect an industrial civilization in the geological record\" given the paucity of geological information about eras before the quaternary.\nAstronomers speculate about the existence of communicating intelligent civilizations within and beyond the Milky Way galaxy, usually using variants of the Drake equation.

{"id": "6259", "revid": "40012178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6259", "title": "Civilization (video game)", "text": "1991 video game\nSid Meier's Civilization is a 1991 turn-based strategy 4X video game developed and published by MicroProse. The game was originally developed for MS-DOS running on a PC, and it has undergone numerous revisions for various platforms. The player is tasked with leading an entire human civilization over the course of several millennia by controlling various areas such as urban development, exploration, government, trade, research, and military. The player can control individual units and advance the exploration, conquest and settlement of the game's world. The player can also make such decisions as setting forms of government, tax rates and research priorities. The player's civilization is in competition with other computer-controlled civilizations, with which the player can enter diplomatic relationships that can either end in alliances or lead to war.\n\"Civilization\" was designed by Sid Meier and Bruce Shelley following the successes of \"Silent Service\", \"Sid Meier's Pirates!\" and \"Railroad Tycoon\". \"Civilization\" has sold 1.5 million copies since its release and is considered one of the most influential computer games in history due to its establishment of the 4X genre. In addition to its commercial and critical success, the game has been deemed pedagogically valuable due to its presentation of historical relationships. A multiplayer remake, Sid Meier's CivNet, was released for the PC in 1995. \"Civilization\" was followed by several sequels starting with \"Civilization II\", with similar or modified scenarios.\nGameplay.\n\"Civilization\" is a turn-based single-player strategy game. The player takes on the role of the ruler of a civilization, starting with one (or occasionally two) settler units, and attempts to build an empire in competition with two to seven other civilizations. The game requires a fair amount of micromanagement (although less than other simulation games). Along with the larger tasks of exploration, warfare and diplomacy, the player has to make decisions about where to build new cities, which improvements or units to build in each city, which advances in knowledge should be sought (and at what rate), and how to transform the land surrounding the cities for maximum benefit. From time to time the player's towns may be harassed by barbarians, units with no specific nationality and no named leader. These threats only come from huts, unclaimed land or sea, so that over time and turns of exploration, there are fewer and fewer places from which barbarians will emanate.\nBefore the game begins, the player chooses which historical or current civilization to play. In contrast to later games in the \"Civilization\" series, this is largely a cosmetic choice, affecting titles, city names, musical heralds, and color. The choice does affect their starting position on the \"Play on Earth\" map, and thus different resources in one's initial cities, but has no effect on starting position when starting a random world game or a customized world game. The player's choice of civilization also prevents the computer from being able to play as that civilization or the other civilization of the same color, and since computer-controlled opponents display certain traits of their civilizations this affects gameplay as well. The Aztecs are both fiercely expansionist and generally extremely wealthy, for example. Other civilizations include the Americans, the Mongols, and Romans. Each civilization is led by a famous historical figure, such as Mahatma Gandhi for India.\nThe scope of \"Civilization\" is larger than most other games. The game begins in 4000 BC, before the Bronze Age, and can last through to AD 2100 (on the easiest setting) with Space Age and \"future technologies\". At the start of the game there are no cities anywhere in the world: the player controls one or two settler units, which can be used to found new cities in appropriate sites (and those cities may build other settler units, which can go out and found new cities, thus expanding the empire). Settlers can also alter terrain, build improvements such as mines and irrigation, build roads to connect cities, and later in the game they can construct railroads which offer unlimited movement.\nAs time advances, new technologies are developed; these technologies are the primary way in which the game changes and grows. At the start, players choose from advances such as pottery, the wheel, and the alphabet to, near the end of the game, nuclear fission and spaceflight. Players can gain a large advantage if their civilization is the first to learn a particular technology (the secrets of flight, for example) and put it to use in a military or other context. Most advances give access to new units, city improvements or derivative technologies: for example, the chariot unit becomes available after the wheel is developed, and the granary building becomes available to build after pottery is developed. The whole system of advancements from beginning to end is called the technology tree, or simply the Tech tree; this concept has been adopted in many other strategy games. Since only one tech may be \"researched\" at any given time, the order in which technologies are chosen makes a considerable difference in the outcome of the game and generally reflects the player's preferred style of gameplay.\nPlayers can also build \"Wonders of the World\" in each of the epochs of the game, subject only to obtaining the prerequisite knowledge. These wonders are important achievements of society, science, culture and defense, ranging from the Pyramids and the Great Wall in the Ancient age, to Copernicus' Observatory and Magellan's Expedition in the middle period, up to the Apollo program, the United Nations, and the Manhattan Project in the modern era. Each wonder can only be built once in the world, and requires a lot of resources to build, far more than most other city buildings or units. Wonders provide unique benefits to the controlling civilization. For example, Magellan's Expedition increases the movement rate of naval units. Wonders typically affect either the city in which they are built (for example, the Colossus), every city on the continent (for example, J.S. Bach's Cathedral), or the civilization as a whole (for example, Darwin's Voyage). Some wonders are made obsolete by new technologies.\nThe game can be won by conquering all other civilizations or by winning the space race by reaching the star system of Alpha Centauri.\nDevelopment.\nPrior \"Civilization\"-named games.\nBritish designer Francis Tresham released his \"Civilization\" board game in 1980 under his company Hartland Trefoil. Avalon Hill had obtained the rights to publish it in the United States in 1981.\nThere were at least two attempts to make a computerized version of Tresham's game prior to 1990. Danielle Bunten Berry planned to start work on the game after completing \"M.U.L.E.\" in 1983, and again in 1985, after completing \"The Seven Cities of Gold\" at Electronic Arts. In 1983 Bunten and producer Joe Ybarra opted to first do \"Seven Cities of Gold\". The success of \"Seven Cities\" in 1985 in turn led to a sequel, \"Heart of Africa\". Bunten never returned to the idea of \"Civilization\". Don Daglow, designer of \"Utopia\", the first simulation game, began work programming a version of \"Civilization\" in 1987. He dropped the project, however, when he was offered an executive position at Br\u00f8derbund, and never returned to the game.\nDevelopment at MicroProse.\nSid Meier and Bill Stealey co-founded MicroProse in 1982 to develop flight simulators and other military strategy video games based on Stealey's past experiences as a United States Air Force pilot. Around 1989, Meier wanted to expand his repertoire beyond these types of games, as just having finished \"F-19 Stealth Fighter\" (1988, 1990), he said \"Everything I thought was cool about a flight simulator had gone into that game.\" He took to heart the success of the new god game genre in particular \"SimCity\" (1989) and \"Populous\" (1989). Specifically with \"SimCity\", Meier recognized that video games could still be entertaining based on building something up. By then, Meier was not an official employee of MicroProse but worked under contract where the company paid him upfront for game development, a large payment on delivery of the game, and additional royalties on each game of his sold.\nMicroProse had hired a number of Avalon Hill game designers, including Bruce Shelley. Among other works, Shelley had been responsible for adapting the railroad-based \"1829\" board game developed by Tresham into \"\". Shelley had joined MicroProse finding that the board game market was weakening in contrast to the video game market, and initially worked on \"F-19 Stealth Fighter\". Meier recognized Shelley's abilities and background in game design and took him on as personal assistant designer to brainstorm new game ideas. The two initially worked on ideas for \"Covert Action\", but had put these aside when they came up with the concepts for \"Railroad Tycoon\" (1990), based loosely on the \"1829\"/\"1830\" board games. \"Railroad Tycoon\" was generally well received at its release, but the title did not fit within the nature of flight simulators and military strategy from MicroProse's previous catalog. Meier and Shelley had started a sequel to \"Railroad Tycoon\" shortly after its release, but Stealey canceled the project.\nOne positive aspect both had taken from \"Railroad Tycoon\" was the idea of multiple smaller systems working together at the same time and the player having to manage them. Both Meier and Shelley recognized that the complex interactions between these systems led players to \"make a lot of interesting decisions\", and that ruling a whole civilization would readily work well with these underlying systems. Some time later, both discussed their love of the original \"Empire\" computer games, and Meier challenged Shelley to give him ten things he would change about \"Empire\"; Shelley provided him with twelve. Around May 1990, Meier presented Shelley with a 5-1/4\" floppy disk which contained the first prototype of \"Civilization\" based on their past discussions and Shelley's list.\nMeier described his development process as sculpting with clay. His prototype took elements from \"Empire\", \"Railroad Tycoon\", \"SimCity\" and the \"Civilization\" board game. This initial version of this game was a real-time simulation, with the player defining zones for their population to grow similar to zoning in \"SimCity\". Meier and Shelley went back and forth with this, with Shelley providing suggestions based on his playthrough and acting as the game's producer, and Meier coding and reworking the game to address these points, and otherwise without involvement of other MicroProse staff. During this period, Stealey and the other managers became concerned that this game did not fit MicroProse's general catalog as strategy computer games had not yet proven successful. A few months into the development, Stealey requested them to put the project on hold and complete \"Covert Action\", after which they could go back to their new game. Meier and Shelley completed \"Covert Action\" which was published in 1990.\nOnce \"Covert Action\" was released, Meier and Shelley returned to the prototype. The time away from the project allowed them to recognize that the real-time aspect was not working well, and reworked the game to become turn-based and dropped the zoning aspect, a change that Meier described as \"like tossing the clay in the trash and getting a new lump\". They incorporated elements of city management and military aspect from \"Empire\", including creating individual military units as well as settler units that replaced the functionality of the zoning approach. Meier felt adding military and combat to the game was necessary as \"The game really isn't about being civilized. The competition is what makes the game fun and the players play their best. At times, you have to make the player uncomfortable for the good of the player\". Meier also opted to include a technology tree that would help to open the game to many more choices to the player as it continued, creating a non-linear experience. Meier felt players would be able to use the technology tree to adopt a style of play and from which they could use technologies to barter with the other opponents. While the game relies on established recorded history, Meier admitted he did not spend much time in research, usually only to assure the proper chronology or spellings; Shelley noted that they wanted to design for fun, not accuracy, and that \"Everything we needed was pretty much available in the children\u2019s section of the library.\"\n\"Computer Gaming World\" reported in 1994 that \"Sid Meier has stated on numerous occasions that he emphasizes the 'fun parts' of a simulation and throws out the rest\". Meier described the process as \"Add another bit [of clay]\u2014no, that went too far. Scrape it off\". He eliminated the potential for any civilization to fall on its own, believing this would be punishing to the player. \"Though historically accurate\", Meier said, \"The moment the Krakatoa volcano blew up, or the bubonic plague came marching through, all anybody wanted to do was reload from a\nsaved game\". Meier omitted multiplayer alliances because the computer used them too effectively, causing players to think that it was cheating. He said that by contrast, minefields and minesweepers caused the computer to do \"stupid things\u00a0... If you've got a feature that makes the AI look stupid, take it out. It's more important not to have stupid AI than to have good AI\". Meier also omitted jets and helicopters because he thought players would not find obtaining new technologies in the endgame useful, and online multiplayer support because of the small number of online players (\"if you had friends, you wouldn't need to play computer games\"); he also did not believe that online play worked well with turn-based play. The game was developed for the IBM PC platform, which at the time had support for both 16-color EGA to 256-color VGA; Meier opted to support both 16-color and 256-color graphics to allow the game to run on both EGA/Tandy and VGA/MCGA systems.\n\"I\u2019ve never been able to decide if it was a mistake to keep Civ isolated as long as I did\", Meier wrote; while \"as many eyes as possible\" are beneficial during development, Meier and Shelley worked very quickly together, combining the roles of playtester, game designer, and programmer. Meier and Shelley neared the end of their development and started presenting the game to the rest of MicroProse for feedback towards publication. This process was slowed by the current vice president of development, who had taken over Meier's former position at the company. This vice president did not receive any financial bonuses for successful publication of Meier's games due to Meier's contract terms, forgoing any incentive to provide the needed resources to finish the game. The management had also expressed issue with the lack of a firm completion date, as according to Shelley, Meier would consider a game completed only when he felt he had completed it. Eventually the two got the required help for publication, with Shelley overseeing these processes and Meier making the necessary coding changes.\n\"One of my big rules has always been, 'double it, or cut it in half'\", Meier wrote. He cut the map's size in half less than a month before \"Civilization\"'s release after playtesting revealed that the previous size was too large and made for boring and repetitive gameplay. Other automated features, like city management, were modified to require more player involvement. They also eliminated a secondary branch of the technology tree with minor skills like beer brewing, and spent time reworking the existing technologies and units to make sure they felt appropriate and did not break the game. Most of the game was originally developed with art crafted by Meier, and MicroProse's art department helped to create most of the final assets, though some of Meier's original art was used. Shelley wrote out the \"Civilopedia\" entries for all the elements of the game and the game's large manual.\nThe name \"Civilization\" came late in the development process. MicroProse recognized at this point the 1980 \"Civilization\" board game may conflict with their video game, as it shared a similar theme including the technology tree. Meier had noted the board game's influence but considered it not as great as \"Empire\" or \"SimCity\", while others have noted significant differences that made the video game far different from the board game such as the non-linearity introduced by Meier's technology tree. To avoid any potential legal issues, MicroProse negotiated a license to use the \"Civilization\" name from Avalon Hill. The addition of Meier's name to the title was from a current practice established by Stealey to attach games like \"Civilization\" that diverged from MicroProse's past catalog to Meier's name, so that players that played Meier's combat simulators and recognized Meier's name would give these new games a try. This approach worked, according to Meier, and he would continue this naming scheme for other titles in the future as a type of branding.\nBy the time the game was completed and ready for release, Meier estimated that it had cost $170,000 in development. \"Civilization\" was released in September 1991. Because of the animosity that MicroProse's management had towards Meier's games, there was very little promotion of the title, though interest in the game through word-of-mouth helped to boost sales. Following the release on the IBM PC, the game was ported to other platforms; Meier and Shelley provided this code to contractors hired by MicroProse to complete the ports.\n\"CivNet\".\n\"Civilization\" was released with only single-player support, with the player working against multiple computer opponents. In 1991, Internet or online gaming was still in its infancy, so this option was not considered in \"Civilization\"'s release. Over the next few years, as home Internet accessibility took off, MicroProse looked to develop an online version of \"Civilization\". This led to the 1995 release of \"Sid Meier's CivNet\". \"CivNet\" allowed for up to seven players to play the game, with computer opponents available to obtain up to six active civilizations. Games could be played either on a turn-based mode, or in a simultaneous mode where each player took their turn at the same time and only progressing to the next turn once all players have confirmed being finished that turn. The game, in addition to better support for Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, supported connectivity through LAN, primitive Internet play, modem, and direct serial link, and included a local hotseat mode. \"CivNet\" also included a map editor and a \"king builder\" to allow a player to customize the names and looks of their civilization as seen by other players.\nAccording to Brian Reynolds, who led the development of \"Civilization II\", MicroProse \"sincerely believed that \"CivNet\" was going to be a much more important product\" than the next single-player \"Civilization\" game that he and Jeff Briggs had started working on. Reynolds said that because their project was seen as a side effort with little risk, they were able to innovate new ideas into \"Civilization II\". As a net result, \"CivNet\" was generally overshadowed by \"Civilization II\" which was released in the following year.\nPost-release.\n\"Civilization\"'s critical success created a \"golden period of MicroProse\" where there was more potential for similar strategy games to succeed, according to Meier. This put stress on the company's direction and culture. Stealey wanted to continue to pursue the military-themed titles, while Meier wanted to continue his success with simulation games. Shelley left MicroProse in 1992 and joined Ensemble Studios, where he used his experience with \"Civilization\" to design the \"Age of Empires\" games. Stealey had pushed MicroProse to develop console and arcade-based versions of their games, but this put the company into debt, and Stealey eventually sold the company to Spectrum HoloByte in 1993; Spectrum HoloByte kept MicroProse as a separate company on acquisition.\nMeier would continue and develop \"Civilization II\" along with Brian Reynolds, who served in a similar role to Shelley as design assistant, as well as help from Jeff Briggs and Douglas Kaufman. This game was released in early 1996, and is considered the first sequel of any Sid Meier game. Stealey eventually sold his shares in MicroProse and left the company, and Spectrum HoloByte opted to consolidate the two companies under the name MicroProse in 1996, eliminating numerous positions at MicroProse in the process. As a result, Meier, Briggs, and Reynolds all opted to leave the company and founded Firaxis, which by 2005 became a subsidiary of Take-Two. After a number of acquisitions and legal actions, the \"Civilization\" brand (both as a board game and video game) is now owned by Take-Two, and Firaxis, under Meier's oversight, continues to develop games in the \"Civilization\" series.\nReception.\n\"Civilization\" has been called one of the most important strategy games of all time, and has a loyal following of fans. This high level of interest has led to the creation of a number of free and open source versions and inspired similar games by other commercial developers.\n\"Computer Gaming World\" stated that \"a new Olympian in the genre of god games has truly emerged\", comparing \"Civilization\"'s importance to computer games to that of the wheel. The game was reviewed in 1992 in \"Dragon\" #183 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. They commented: \"\"Civilization\" is one of the highest dollar-to-play-ratio entertainments we've enjoyed. The scope is enormous, the strategies border on being limitless, the excitement is genuinely high, and the experience is worth every dime of the game's purchase price.\"\nJeff Koke reviewed \"Civilization\" in \"Pyramid\" #2 (July/Aug., 1993), and stated that \"Ultimately, there are games that are a lot flashier than \"Civilization\", with cool graphics and animation, but there aren't many - or any - in my book that have the ability to absorb the player so totally and to provide an interesting, unique outcome each and every time it's played.\"\n\"Civilization\" won the Origins Award in the category Best Military or Strategy Computer Game of 1991. A 1992 \"Computer Gaming World\" survey of wargames with modern settings gave the game five stars out of five, describing it as \"more addictive than crack\u00a0... so rich and textured that the documentation is incomplete\". In 1992 the magazine named it the Overall Game of the Year, in 1993 added the game to its Hall of Fame, and in 1996 chose \"Civilization\" as the best game of all time:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;While some games might be equally addictive, none have sustained quite the level of rich, satisfying gameplay quite like Sid Meier's magnum opus. The blend of exploration, economics, conquest and diplomacy is augmented by the quintessential research and development model, as you struggle to erect the Pyramids, discover gunpowder, and launch a colonization spacecraft to \"Alpha Centauri\". For its day, \"Civilization\" had the toughest computer opponents around - even taking into account the \"cheats\", that in most instances added rather than detracted from the game. Just when you think the game might bog down, you discover a new land, a new technology, another tough foe - and you tell yourself, \"just one more game\", even as the first rays of the new sun creep into your room\u00a0... the most acute case of game-lock we've ever felt.\nA critic for \"Next Generation\" judged the Super NES version to be a disappointing port, with a cumbersome menu system (particularly that the \"City\" and \"Production\" windows are on separate screens), an unintuitive button configuration, and ugly scaled down graphics. However, he gave it a positive recommendation due to the strong gameplay and strategy of the original game: \"if you've never taken a crack at this game before, be prepared to lose hours, even days, trying to conquer those pesky Babylonians.\" Sir Garnabus of \"GamePro\", in contrast, was pleased with the Super NES version's interface, and said the graphics and audio are above that of a typical strategy game. He also said the game stood out among the Super NES's generally action-oriented library.\nIn 2000, GameSpot rated \"Civilization\" as the tenth most influential video game of all time. It was also ranked at fourth place on \"IGN\"'s 2000 list of the top PC games of all time. In 2004, readers of \"Retro Gamer\" voted it as the 29th top retro game. In 2007, it was named one of the 16 most influential games in history at a German technology and games trade show Telespiele. In Poland, it was included in the retrospective lists of the best Amiga games by Wirtualna Polska (ranked ninth) and \"CHIP\" (ranked fifth). In 2012, \"Time\" named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time. In 1994, \"PC Gamer US\" named \"Civilization\" the second best computer game ever. The editors wrote, \"The depth of strategies possible is impressive, and the look and feel of the game will keep you playing and exploring for months. Truly a remarkable title.\" That same year, \"PC Gamer UK\" named its Windows release the sixth best computer game of all time, calling it Sid Meier's \"crowning glory\".\nOn March 12, 2007, \"The New York Times\" reported on a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so-called game canon, including \"Civilization\".\nBy the release of \"Civilization II\" in 1996, \"Civilization\" had sold over 850,000 copies. By 2001, sales had reached 1 million copies. Shelley stated in a 2016 interview that \"Civilization\" had sold 1.5 million copies.\nIn 2022, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted \"Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization\" to its World Video Game Hall of Fame.\nLegacy.\nThere have been several sequels to \"Civilization\", including \"Civilization II\" (1996), \"Civilization III\" (2001), \"Civilization IV\" (2005), \"Civilization Revolution\" (2008), \"Civilization V\" (2010), and \"Civilization VI\" in 2016. In 1994, Meier produced a similar game titled \"Colonization\".\n\"Civilization\" is generally considered the first major game in the genre of \"4X\", with the four \"X\"s equating to \"explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate\", a term developed by Alan Emrich in promoting 1993's \"Master of Orion\". While other video games with the principles of 4X had been released prior to \"Civilization\", future 4X games would attribute some of their basic design principles to \"Civilization\".\nA famous supposed bug in the original game - later debunked - is that a computer-controlled Gandhi, normally a highly peaceful leader, could become a nuclear warmonger if provoked. It was theorized that the game started Gandhi's \"aggression value\" at 1 out of a maximum 255 possible for an 8-bit unsigned integer, making a computer-controlled Gandhi tend to avoid armed conflict. However, once a civilization achieves democracy as its form of government, its leader's aggression value falls by 2. Under normal arithmetic principles, Gandhi's \"1\" would be reduced to \"-1\", but because the value is an 8-bit unsigned integer, it supposedly wraps around to \"255\", causing Gandhi to suddenly become the most aggressive opponent in the game. \nInterviewed in 2019, developer Brian Reynolds said with \"99.99% certainty\" that this story was apocryphal, recalling Gandhi's coded aggression level as being no lower than other peaceful leaders in the game, and doubting that a wraparound would have had the effect described. He noted that all leaders in the game become \"pretty ornery\" after their acquisition of nuclear weapons, and suggested that this behaviour simply seemed more surprising and memorable when it happened to Gandhi. Meier, in his autobiography, stated \"That kind of bug comes from something called unsigned characters, which are not the default in the C programming language, and not something I used for the leader traits. Brian Reynolds wrote Civ II in C++, and he didn't use them, either. We received no complaints about a Gandhi bug when either game came out, nor did we send out any revisions for one. Gandhi's military aggressiveness score remained at 1 throughout the game.\" He then explains the overflow error story was made up in 2012. It spread from there to a Wikia entry, then eventually to Reddit, and was picked up by news sites like Kotaku and Geek.com. The story may have originated from the fact that 2010's \"Civilization V\" was deliberately written with Gandhi having an affinity for nuclear weapons, added as a joke by developer Jon Shafer. The misinformation around this bug led to the meme known as \"Nuclear Gandhi\".\nAnother relic of \"Civilization\" was the nature of combat where a military unit from earlier civilization periods could remain in play through modern times, gaining combat bonuses due to veteran proficiency, leading to these primitive units easily beating out modern technology against all common sense, with the common example of a veteran phalanx unit able to fend off a battleship. Meier noted that this resulted from not anticipating how players would use units, expecting them to have used their forces more like a war-based board game to protect borders and maintain zones of control rather than creating \"stacks of doom\". Future civilization games have had many changes in combat systems to prevent such oddities, though these games do allow for such random victories.\nThe 1999 game \"Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri\" was also created by Meier and is in the same genre, but with a futuristic/space theme; many of the interface and gameplay innovations in this game eventually made their way into \"Civilization III\" and \"IV\". \"Alpha Centauri\" is not actually a sequel to \"Civilization\", despite beginning with the same event that ends \"Civilization\" and \"Civilization II\": a crewed spacecraft from Earth arrives in the Alpha Centauri star system. Firaxis' 2014 game \"\", although bearing the name of the main series, is a reimagining of \"Alpha Centauri\" running on the engine of \"Civilization V\".\nA 1994 \"Computer Gaming World\" survey of space war games stated that \"the lesson of this incredibly popular wargame has not been lost on the software community, and technological research popped up all over the place in 1993\", citing \"Spaceward Ho!\" and \"Master of Orion\" as examples. That year MicroProse published \"Master of Magic\", a similar game but embedded in a medieval-fantasy setting where instead of technologies the player (a powerful wizard) develops spells, among other things. In 1999, Activision released \"\", a sequel of sorts to \"Civilization II\" but created by a completely different design team. \"Call to Power\" spawned a sequel in 2000, but by then Activision had sold the rights to the \"Civilization\" name and could only call it \"Call to Power II\".\nAn open source clone of \"Civilization\" has been developed under the name of \"Freeciv\", with the slogan \"'Cause civilization should be free.\" This game can be configured to match the rules of either \"Civilization\" or \"Civilization II\". Another game that partially clones \"Civilization\" is a public domain game called \"C-evo\".\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6260", "revid": "724850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6260", "title": "Claude Debussy", "text": "French classical composer (1862\u20131918)\n(Achille) Claude Debussy (]; 22 August 1862\u00a0\u2013 25 March 1918) was a French composer. He is sometimes seen as the first Impressionist composer, although he vigorously rejected the term. He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nBorn to a family of modest means and little cultural involvement, Debussy showed enough musical talent to be admitted at the age of ten to France's leading music college, the Conservatoire de Paris. He originally studied the piano, but found his vocation in innovative composition, despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire's conservative professors. He took many years to develop his mature style, and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed, \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\".\nDebussy's orchestral works include \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\" (1894), \"Nocturnes\" (1897\u20131899) and \"Images\" (1905\u20131912). His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against Wagner and the German musical tradition. He regarded the classical symphony as obsolete and sought an alternative in his \"symphonic sketches\", \"La mer\" (1903\u20131905). His piano works include sets of 24 Pr\u00e9ludes and 12 \u00c9tudes. Throughout his career he wrote \"m\u00e9lodies\" based on a wide variety of poetry, including his own. He was greatly influenced by the Symbolist poetic movement of the later 19th century. A small number of works, including the early \"La Damoiselle \u00e9lue\" and the late \"Le Martyre de saint S\u00e9bastien\" have important parts for chorus. In his final years, he focused on chamber music, completing three of six planned sonatas for different combinations of instruments.\nWith early influences including Russian and Far Eastern music and works by Chopin, Debussy developed his own style of harmony and orchestral colouring, derided \u2013 and unsuccessfully resisted \u2013 by much of the musical establishment of the day. His works have strongly influenced a wide range of composers including B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Olivier Messiaen, George Benjamin, and the jazz pianist and composer Bill Evans. Debussy died from cancer at his home in Paris at the age of 55 after a composing career of a little more than 30 years.\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nDebussy was born on 22 August 1862 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Seine-et-Oise, on the north-west fringes of Paris.{{refn|Debussy's birthplace is now a museum dedicated to him. In addition to displays depicting his life and work, the building contains a small auditorium in which an annual season of concerts is given.|group= n}} He was the eldest of the five children of Manuel-Achille Debussy and his wife, Victorine, \"n\u00e9e\" Manoury. Debussy senior ran a china shop and his wife was a seamstress. The shop was unsuccessful, and closed in 1864; the family moved to Paris, first living with Victorine's mother, in Clichy, and, from 1868, in their own apartment in the Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9. Manuel worked in a printing factory.\nDebussy's talents soon became evident, and in 1872, aged ten, he was admitted to the Conservatoire de Paris, where he remained a student for the next eleven years. He first joined the piano class of Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Marmontel, and studied solf\u00e8ge with Albert Lavignac and, later, composition with Ernest Guiraud, harmony with \u00c9mile Durand, and organ with C\u00e9sar Franck. The course included music history and theory studies with Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray, but it is not certain that Debussy, who was apt to skip classes, actually attended these.\nAt the Conservatoire, Debussy initially made good progress. Marmontel said of him \"A charming child, a truly artistic temperament; much can be expected of him\". Another teacher was less impressed: \u00c9mile Durand wrote in a report \"Debussy would be an excellent pupil if he were less sketchy and less cavalier.\" A year later he described Debussy as \"desperately careless\". In July 1874 Debussy received the award of \"deuxi\u00e8me accessit\"{{refn|That is, fourth prize, after the \"premier accessit\", the runner-up (\"second prix\") and the winner (\"premier prix\").|group= n}} for his performance as soloist in the first movement of Chopin's Second Piano Concerto at the Conservatoire's annual competition. He was a fine pianist and an outstanding sight reader, who could have had a professional career had he wished, but he was only intermittently diligent in his studies. He advanced to \"premier accessit\" in 1875 and second prize in 1877, but failed at the competitions in 1878 and 1879. These failures made him ineligible to continue in the Conservatoire's piano classes, but he remained a student for harmony, solf\u00e8ge and, later, composition.\nPrix de Rome.\nAt the end of 1880 Debussy, while continuing his studies at the Conservatoire, was engaged as accompanist for Marie Moreau-Sainti's singing class; he took this role for four years. Among the members of the class was Marie Vasnier; Debussy was greatly taken with her, and she inspired him to compose: he wrote 27 songs dedicated to her during their seven-year relationship. She was the wife of Henri Vasnier, a prominent civil servant, and much younger than her husband. She soon became Debussy's lover as well as his muse. Whether Vasnier was content to tolerate his wife's affair with the young student or was simply unaware of it is not clear, but he and Debussy remained on excellent terms, and he continued to encourage the composer in his career.\nAt the Conservatoire, Debussy incurred the disapproval of the faculty, particularly his composition teacher, Guiraud, for his failure to follow the orthodox rules of composition then prevailing.{{refn|The director of the Conservatoire, Ambroise Thomas, was a deeply conservative musician, as were most of his faculty. It was not until Gabriel Faur\u00e9 became director in 1905 that modern music such as Debussy's or even Wagner's was accepted within the Conservatoire.|group= n}} Nevertheless, in 1884 Debussy won France's most prestigious musical award, the Prix de Rome, with his cantata \"L'enfant prodigue\". The Prix carried with it a residence at the Villa Medici, the French Academy in Rome, to further the winner's studies. Debussy was there from January 1885 to March 1887, with three or possibly four absences of several weeks when he returned to France, chiefly to see Marie Vasnier.\nInitially Debussy found the artistic atmosphere of the Villa Medici stifling, the company boorish, the food bad, and the accommodation \"abominable\". Neither did he delight in Italian opera, as he found the operas of Donizetti and Verdi not to his taste. He was much more impressed by the music of the 16th-century composers Palestrina and Lassus, which he heard at Santa Maria dell'Anima: \"The only church music I will accept\". He was often depressed and unable to compose, but he was inspired by Franz Liszt, who visited the students and played for them. In June 1885, Debussy wrote of his desire to follow his own way, saying, \"I am sure the Institute would not approve, for, naturally it regards the path which it ordains as the only right one. But there is no help for it! I am too enamoured of my freedom, too fond of my own ideas!\"\nDebussy finally composed four pieces that were submitted to the Academy: the symphonic ode \"Zuleima\" (based on a text by Heinrich Heine); the orchestral piece \"Printemps\"; the cantata \"La Damoiselle \u00e9lue\" (1887\u20131888), the first piece in which the stylistic features of his later music began to emerge; and the \"Fantaisie\" for piano and orchestra, which was heavily based on Franck's music and was eventually withdrawn by Debussy. The Academy chided him for writing music that was \"bizarre, incomprehensible and unperformable\". Although Debussy's works showed the influence of Jules Massenet, the latter concluded, \"He is an enigma\". During his years in Rome Debussy composed \u2013 not for the Academy \u2013 most of his Verlaine cycle, \"Ariettes oubli\u00e9es\", which made little impact at the time but was successfully republished in 1903 after the composer had become well known.\nReturn to Paris, 1887.\nA week after his return to Paris in 1887, Debussy heard the first act of Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\" at the Concerts Lamoureux, and judged it \"decidedly the finest thing I know\". In 1888 and 1889 he went to the annual festivals of Wagner's operas at Bayreuth. He responded positively to Wagner's sensuousness, mastery of form, and striking harmonies, and was briefly influenced by them, but, unlike some other French composers of his generation, he concluded that there was no future in attempting to adopt and develop Wagner's style. He commented in 1903 that Wagner was \"a beautiful sunset that was mistaken for a dawn\".\nMarie Vasnier ended her liaison with Debussy soon after his final return from Rome, although they remained on good enough terms for him to dedicate to her one more song, \"Mandoline\", in 1890. Later in 1890 Debussy met Erik Satie, who proved a kindred spirit in his experimental approach to composition. Both were bohemians, enjoying the same caf\u00e9 society and struggling to survive financially. In the same year Debussy began a relationship with Gabrielle (Gaby) Dupont, a tailor's daughter from Lisieux; in July 1893 they began living together.\nDebussy continued to compose songs, piano pieces and other works, some of which were publicly performed, but his music made only a modest impact, although his fellow composers recognised his potential by electing him to the committee of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique in 1893. His String Quartet was premiered by the Ysa\u00ffe string quartet at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale in the same year. In May 1893 Debussy attended a theatrical event that was of key importance to his later career \u2013 the premiere of Maurice Maeterlinck's play \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\", which he immediately determined to turn into an opera. He travelled to Maeterlinck's home in Ghent in November to secure his consent to an operatic adaptation.\n1894\u20131902: \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\".\nIn February 1894 Debussy completed the first draft of Act I of his operatic version of \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\", and for most of the year worked to complete the work. While still living with Dupont, he had an affair with the singer Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Roger, and in 1894 he announced their engagement. His behaviour was widely condemned; anonymous letters circulated denouncing his treatment of both women, as well as his financial irresponsibility and debts. The engagement was broken off, and several of Debussy's friends and supporters disowned him, including Ernest Chausson, hitherto one of his strongest supporters.\nIn terms of musical recognition, Debussy made a step forward in December 1894, when the symphonic poem \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\", based on St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9's poem, was premiered at a concert of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale. The following year he completed the first draft of \"Pell\u00e9as\" and began efforts to get it staged. In May 1898 he made his first contacts with Andr\u00e9 Messager and Albert Carr\u00e9, respectively the musical director and general manager of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, Paris, about presenting the opera.\nDebussy abandoned Dupont for her friend Marie-Rosalie Texier, known as \"Lilly\", whom he married in October 1899, after threatening suicide if she refused him. She was affectionate, practical, straightforward, and well liked by Debussy's friends and associates, but he became increasingly irritated by her intellectual limitations and lack of musical sensitivity. The marriage lasted barely five years.\nFrom around 1900 Debussy's music became a focus and inspiration for an informal group of innovative young artists, poets, critics, and musicians who began meeting in Paris. They called themselves \"Les Apaches\" \u2013 roughly \"The Hooligans\" \u2013 to represent their status as \"artistic outcasts\" The membership was fluid, but at various times included Maurice Ravel, Ricardo Vi\u00f1es, Igor Stravinsky and Manuel de Falla.{{#tag:ref|Other members were the composers Florent Schmitt, Maurice Delage and Paul Ladmirault, the poets L\u00e9on-Paul Fargue and Tristan Klingsor, the painter Paul Sordes and the critic Michel Calvocoressi.|group= n}} In the same year the first two of Debussy's three orchestral \"Nocturnes\" were first performed. Although they did not make any great impact with the public they were well reviewed by musicians including Paul Dukas, Alfred Bruneau and Pierre de Br\u00e9ville. The complete set was given the following year.\nLike many other composers of the time, Debussy supplemented his income by teaching and writing.{{refn|Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Franck, Massenet, Faur\u00e9 and Ravel were all known as teachers, and Faur\u00e9, Messager and Dukas were regular music critics for Parisian journals.|group= n}} For most of 1901 he had a sideline as music critic of \"La Revue Blanche\", adopting the pen name \"Monsieur Croche\". He expressed trenchant views on composers (\"I hate sentimentality \u2013 his name is Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns\"), institutions (on the Paris Op\u00e9ra: \"A stranger would take it for a railway station, and, once inside, would mistake it for a Turkish bath\"), conductors (\"Nikisch is a unique virtuoso, so much so that his virtuosity seems to make him forget the claims of good taste\"), musical politics (\"The English actually think that a musician can manage an opera house successfully!\"), and audiences (\"their almost drugged expression of boredom, indifference and even stupidity\"). He later collected his criticisms with a view to their publication as a book; it was published after his death as \"Monsieur Croche, Antidilettante\".\nIn January 1902 rehearsals began at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique for the opening of \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\". For three months, Debussy attended rehearsals practically every day. In February there was conflict between Maeterlinck on the one hand and Debussy, Messager and Carr\u00e9 on the other about the casting of M\u00e9lisande. Maeterlinck wanted his mistress, Georgette Leblanc, to sing the role, and was incensed when she was passed over in favour of the Scottish soprano Mary Garden.{{refn|Mary Garden was Messager's mistress at the time, but as far as is known she was chosen for wholly musical and dramatic reasons. She is described in the \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" as \"a supreme singing-actress, with uncommonly vivid powers of characterization\u00a0... and a rare subtlety of colour and phrasing.\"|group= n}} The opera opened on 30 April 1902, and although the first-night audience was divided between admirers and sceptics, the work quickly became a success. It made Debussy a well-known name in France and abroad; \"The Times\" commented that the opera had \"provoked more discussion than any work of modern times, excepting, of course, those of Richard Strauss\". The Apaches, led by Ravel (who attended every one of the 14 performances in the first run), were loud in their support; the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire tried in vain to stop its students from seeing the opera. The vocal score was published in early May, and the full orchestral score in 1904.\n1903\u20131918.\nIn 1903 there was public recognition of Debussy's stature when he was appointed a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, but his social standing suffered a great blow when another turn in his private life caused a scandal the following year. Among his pupils was Raoul Bardac, son of Emma, the wife of a Parisian banker, Sigismond Bardac. Raoul introduced his teacher to his mother, to whom Debussy quickly became greatly attracted. She was a sophisticate, a brilliant conversationalist, an accomplished singer, and relaxed about marital fidelity, having been the mistress and muse of Gabriel Faur\u00e9 a few years earlier. After despatching Lilly to her parental home at Bichain in Villeneuve-la-Guyard on 15 July 1904, Debussy took Emma away, staying incognito in Jersey and then at Pourville in Normandy. He wrote to his wife on 11 August from Dieppe, telling her that their marriage was over, but still making no mention of Bardac. When he returned to Paris he set up home on his own, taking a flat in a different arrondissement. On 14 October, five days before their fifth wedding anniversary, Lilly Debussy attempted suicide, shooting herself in the chest with a revolver;{{refn|A fictionalised and melodramatic dramatisation of the affair, \"La femme nue\", played in Paris in 1908. A myth grew up that Lilly Debussy shot herself in the Place de la Concorde, rather than at home. That version of events is not corroborated by Debussy scholars such as Marcel Dietschy, Roger Nichols, Robert Orledge and Nigel Simeone; and no mention of the Place de la Concorde appeared in even the most sensational press coverage at the time. Another inaccurate report of the case, in \"Le Figaro\" in early January 1905, stated that Lilly had made a second attempt at suicide.|group= n}} she survived, although the bullet remained lodged in her vertebrae for the rest of her life. The ensuing scandal caused Bardac's family to disown her, and Debussy lost many good friends including Dukas and Messager. His relations with Ravel, never close, were exacerbated when the latter joined other former friends of Debussy in contributing to a fund to support the deserted Lilly.\nThe Bardacs divorced in May 1905. Finding the hostility in Paris intolerable, Debussy and Emma (now pregnant) went to England. They stayed at the Grand Hotel, Eastbourne in July and August, where Debussy corrected the proofs of his symphonic sketches\" La mer\", celebrating his divorce on 2\u00a0August. After a brief visit to London, the couple returned to Paris in September, buying a house in a courtyard development off the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne (now Avenue Foch), Debussy's home for the rest of his life.\nIn October 1905 \"La mer\", Debussy's most substantial orchestral work, was premiered in Paris by the Orchestre Lamoureux under the direction of Camille Chevillard; the reception was mixed. Some praised the work, but Pierre Lalo, critic of \"Le Temps\", hitherto an admirer of Debussy, wrote, \"I do not hear, I do not see, I do not smell the sea\".{{refn|Lalo objected to what he felt was the artificiality of the piece: \"a reproduction of nature; a wonderfully refined, ingenious and carefully composed reproduction, but a reproduction none the less\". Another Parisian critic, Louis Schneider, wrote, \"The audience seemed rather disappointed: they expected the ocean, something big, something colossal, but they were served instead with some agitated water in a saucer.\"|group= n}} In the same month the composer's only child was born at their home. Claude-Emma, affectionately known as \"Chouchou\", was a musical inspiration to the composer (she was the dedicatee of his \"Children's Corner\" suite). She outlived her father by scarcely a year, succumbing to the diphtheria epidemic of 1919. Mary Garden said, \"I honestly don't know if Debussy ever loved anybody really. He loved his music \u2013 and perhaps himself. I think he was wrapped up in his genius\", but biographers are agreed that whatever his relations with lovers and friends, Debussy was devoted to his daughter.\nDebussy and Emma Bardac eventually married in 1908, their troubled union enduring for the rest of his life. The following year began well, when at Faur\u00e9's invitation, Debussy became a member of the governing council of the Conservatoire. His success in London was consolidated in April 1909, when he conducted \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\" and the \"Nocturnes\" at the Queen's Hall; in May he was present at the first London production of \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\", at Covent Garden. In the same year, Debussy was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, from which he was to die nine years later.\nDebussy's works began to feature increasingly in concert programmes at home and overseas. In 1910 Gustav Mahler conducted the \"Nocturnes\" and \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\" in New York in successive months. In the same year, visiting Budapest, Debussy commented that his works were better known there than in Paris. In 1912 Sergei Diaghilev commissioned a new ballet score, \"Jeux\". That, and the three \"Images\", premiered the following year, were the composer's last orchestral works. \"Jeux\" was unfortunate in its timing: two weeks after the premiere, in March 1913, Diaghilev presented the first performance of Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\", a sensational event that monopolised discussion in musical circles, and effectively sidelined \"Jeux\" along with Faur\u00e9's \"P\u00e9n\u00e9lope\", which had opened a week before.\nIn 1915 Debussy underwent one of the earliest colostomy operations. It achieved only a temporary respite, and occasioned him considerable frustration (\"There are mornings when the effort of dressing seems like one of the twelve labours of Hercules\"). He also had a fierce enemy at this period in the form of Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, who in a letter to Faur\u00e9 condemned Debussy's \"En blanc et noir\": \"It's incredible, and the door of the Institut [de France] must at all costs be barred against a man capable of such atrocities\". Saint-Sa\u00ebns had been a member of the Institut since 1881: Debussy never became one. His health continued to decline; he gave his final concert on 14 September 1917 and became bedridden in early 1918.\nDebussy died on 25 March 1918 at his home. The First World War was still raging and Paris was under German aerial and artillery bombardment. The military situation did not permit the honour of a public funeral with ceremonious graveside orations. The funeral procession made its way through deserted streets to a temporary grave at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery as the German guns bombarded the city. Debussy's body was reinterred the following year in the small Passy Cemetery sequestered behind the Trocad\u00e9ro, fulfilling his wish to rest \"among the trees and the birds\"; his wife and daughter are buried with him.\nWorks.\nIn a survey of Debussy's oeuvre shortly after the composer's death, the critic Ernest Newman wrote, \"It would be hardly too much to say that Debussy spent a third of his life in the discovery of himself, a third in the free and happy realisation of himself, and the final third in the partial, painful loss of himself\". Later commentators have rated some of the late works more highly than Newman and other contemporaries did, but much of the music for which Debussy is best known is from the middle years of his career.\nThe analyst David Cox wrote in 1974 that Debussy, admiring Wagner's attempts to combine all the creative arts, \"created a new, instinctive, dreamlike world of music, lyrical and pantheistic, contemplative and objective \u2013 a kind of art, in fact, which seemed to reach out into all aspects of experience\". In 1988 the composer and scholar Wilfrid Mellers wrote of Debussy:\nDebussy did not give his works opus numbers, apart from his String Quartet, Op. 10 in G minor (also the only work where the composer's title included a key). His works were catalogued and indexed by the musicologist Fran\u00e7ois Lesure in 1977 (revised in 2003) and their Lesure number (\"L\" followed by a number) is sometimes used as a suffix to their title in concert programmes and recordings.\nEarly works, 1879\u20131892.\nfilename=Clair de lune (Claude Debussy) Suite bergamasque.ogg|title=\"Clair de Lune\" (5:04)|description=Composed in 1890, performed by Laurens Goedhart in 2011|\nDebussy's musical development was slow, and as a student he was adept enough to produce for his teachers at the Conservatoire works that would conform to their conservative precepts. His friend Georges Jean-Aubry commented that Debussy \"admirably imitated Massenet's melodic turns of phrase\" in the cantata \"L'enfant prodigue\" (1884) which won him the Prix de Rome. A more characteristically Debussian work from his early years is \"La Damoiselle \u00e9lue\", recasting the traditional form for oratorios and cantatas, using a chamber orchestra and a small body of choral tone and using new or long-neglected scales and harmonies. His early \"m\u00e9lodies\", inspired by Marie Vasnier, are more virtuosic in character than his later works in the genre, with extensive wordless \"vocalise\"; from the \"Ariettes oubli\u00e9es\" (1885\u20131887) onwards he developed a more restrained style. He wrote his own poems for the \"Proses lyriques\" (1892\u20131893) but, in the view of the musical scholar Robert Orledge, \"his literary talents were not on a par with his musical imagination\".\nThe musicologist Jacques-Gabriel Prod'homme wrote that, together with \"La Demoiselle \u00e9lue\", the \"Ariettes oubli\u00e9es\" and the \"Cinq po\u00e8mes de Charles Baudelaire\" (1889) show \"the new, strange way which the young musician will hereafter follow\". Newman concurred: \"There is a good deal of Wagner, especially of \"Tristan\", in the idiom. But the work as a whole is distinctive, and the first in which we get a hint of the Debussy we were to know later \u2013 the lover of vague outlines, of half-lights, of mysterious consonances and dissonances of colour, the apostle of languor, the exclusivist in thought and in style.\" During the next few years Debussy developed his personal style, without, at this stage, breaking sharply away from French musical traditions. Much of his music from this period is on a small scale, such as the \"Two Arabesques\", \"Valse romantique\", \"Suite bergamasque\", and the first set of \"F\u00eates galantes\". Newman remarked that, like Chopin, the Debussy of this period appears as a liberator from Germanic styles of composition \u2013 offering instead \"an exquisite, pellucid style\" capable of conveying \"not only gaiety and whimsicality but emotion of a deeper sort\". In a 2004 study, Mark DeVoto comments that Debussy's early works are harmonically no more adventurous than existing music by Faur\u00e9; in a 2007 book about the piano works, Margery Halford observes that \"Two Arabesques\" (1888\u20131891) and \"R\u00eaverie\" (1890) have \"the fluidity and warmth of Debussy's later style\" but are not harmonically innovative. Halford cites the popular \"Clair de Lune\" (1890), the third of the four movements of \"Suite Bergamasque\", as a transitional work pointing towards the composer's mature style.\nMiddle works, 1893\u20131905.\nMusicians from Debussy's time onwards have regarded \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\" (1894) as his first orchestral masterpiece. Newman considered it \"completely original in idea, absolutely personal in style, and logical and coherent from first to last, without a superfluous bar or even a superfluous note\"; Pierre Boulez observed, \"Modern music was awakened by \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\"\". Most of the major works for which Debussy is best known were written between the mid-1890s and the mid-1900s. They include the String Quartet (1893), \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" (1893\u20131902), the \"Nocturnes for Orchestra\" (1899) and \"La mer\" (1903\u20131905). The suite \"Pour le piano\" (1894\u20131901) is, in Halford's view, one of the first examples of the mature Debussy as a composer for the piano: \"a major landmark\u00a0... and an enlargement of the use of piano sonorities\".\nIn the String Quartet (1893), the gamelan sonorities Debussy had heard four years earlier are recalled in the pizzicatos and cross-rhythms of the scherzo. Debussy's biographer Edward Lockspeiser comments that this movement shows the composer's rejection of \"the traditional dictum that string instruments should be predominantly lyrical\". The work influenced Ravel, whose own String Quartet, written ten years later, has noticeably Debussian features. The academic and journalist Stephen Walsh calls \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" (begun 1893, staged 1902) \"a key work for the 20th century\". The composer Olivier Messiaen was fascinated by its \"extraordinary harmonic qualities and\u00a0... transparent instrumental texture\". The opera is composed in what Alan Blyth describes as a sustained and heightened recitative style, with \"sensuous, intimate\" vocal lines. It influenced composers as different as Stravinsky and Puccini.\nOrledge describes the \"Nocturnes\" as exceptionally varied in texture, \"ranging from the Musorgskian start of 'Nuages', through the approaching brass band procession in 'F\u00eates', to the wordless female chorus in 'Sir\u00e8nes{{'\"}}. Orledge considers the last a pre-echo of the marine textures of \"La mer\". \"Estampes\" for piano (1903) gives impressions of exotic locations, with further echoes of the gamelan in its pentatonic structures. Debussy believed that since Beethoven, the traditional symphonic form had become formulaic, repetitive and obsolete.{{refn|He described the symphonies of Schumann and Mendelssohn as \"respectful repetition\"|group= n}} The three-part, cyclic symphony by C\u00e9sar Franck (1888) was more to his liking, and its influence can be found in \"La mer\" (1905); this uses a quasi-symphonic form, its three sections making up a giant sonata-form movement with, as Orledge observes, a cyclic theme, in the manner of Franck. The central \"Jeux de vagues\" section has the function of a symphonic development section leading into the final \"Dialogue du vent et de la mer\", \"a powerful essay in orchestral colour and sonority\" (Orledge) which reworks themes from the first movement. The reviews were sharply divided. Some critics thought the treatment less subtle and less mysterious than his previous works, and even a step backward; others praised its \"power and charm\", its \"extraordinary verve and brilliant fantasy\", and its strong colours and definite lines.\nLate works, 1906\u20131917.\nOf the later orchestral works, \"Images\" (1905\u20131912) is better known than \"Jeux\" (1913). The former follows the tripartite form established in the \"Nocturnes\" and \"La mer\", but differs in employing traditional British and French folk tunes, and in making the central movement, \"Ib\u00e9ria\", far longer than the outer ones, and subdividing it into three parts, all inspired by scenes from Spanish life. Although considering \"Images\" \"the pinnacle of Debussy's achievement as a composer for orchestra\", Trezise notes a contrary view that the accolade belongs to the ballet score \"Jeux\". The latter failed as a ballet because of what Jann Pasler describes as a banal scenario, and the score was neglected for some years. Recent analysts have found it a link between traditional continuity and thematic growth within a score and the desire to create discontinuity in a way mirrored in later 20th century music. In this piece, Debussy abandoned the whole-tone scale he had often favoured previously in favour of the octatonic scale with what the Debussy scholar Fran\u00e7ois Lesure describes as its tonal ambiguities.\nfilename=The Girl with the Flaxen Hair.ogg|title= \"La fille aux cheveux de lin\"|description=Performed by Mike Ambrose|\nAmong the late piano works are two books of \"Pr\u00e9ludes\" (1909\u201310, 1911\u201313), short pieces that depict a wide range of subjects. Lesure comments that they range from the frolics of minstrels at Eastbourne in 1905 and the American acrobat \"General Lavine\" \"to dead leaves and the sounds and scents of the evening air\". \"En blanc et noir\" (In white and black, 1915), a three-movement work for two pianos, is a predominantly sombre piece, reflecting the war and national danger. The \"\u00c9tudes\" (1915) for piano have divided opinion. Writing soon after Debussy's death, Newman found them laboured \u2013 \"a strange last chapter in a great artist's life\"; Lesure, writing eighty years later, rates them among Debussy's greatest late works: \"Behind a pedagogic exterior, these 12 pieces explore abstract intervals, or \u2013 in the last five \u2013 the sonorities and timbres peculiar to the piano.\" In 1914 Debussy started work on a planned set of six sonatas for various instruments. His fatal illness prevented him from completing the set, but those for cello and piano (1915), flute, viola and harp (1915), and violin and piano (1917 \u2013 his last completed work) are all concise, three-movement pieces, more diatonic in nature than some of his other late works.\n\"Le Martyre de saint S\u00e9bastien\" (1911), originally a five-act musical play to a text by Gabriele D'Annunzio that took nearly five hours in performance, was not a success, and the music is now more often heard in a concert (or studio) adaptation with narrator, or as an orchestral suite of \"Fragments symphoniques\". Debussy enlisted the help of Andr\u00e9 Caplet in orchestrating and arranging the score. Two late stage works, the ballets \"Khamma\" (1912) and \"La bo\u00eete \u00e0 joujoux\" (1913), were left with the orchestration incomplete, and were completed by Charles Koechlin and Caplet, respectively.\nStyle.\nDebussy and Impressionism.\nThe application of the term \"Impressionist\" to Debussy and the music he influenced has been much debated, both during his lifetime and since. The analyst Richard Langham Smith writes that Impressionism was originally a term coined to describe a style of late 19th-century French painting, typically scenes suffused with reflected light in which the emphasis is on the overall impression rather than outline or clarity of detail, as in works by Monet, Pissarro, Renoir and others. Langham Smith writes that the term became transferred to the compositions of Debussy and others which were \"concerned with the representation of landscape or natural phenomena, particularly the water and light imagery dear to Impressionists, through subtle textures suffused with instrumental colour\".\nAmong painters, Debussy particularly admired Turner, but also drew inspiration from Whistler. With the latter in mind the composer wrote to the violinist Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe in 1894 describing the orchestral \"Nocturnes\" as \"an experiment in the different combinations that can be obtained from one colour \u2013 what a study in grey would be in painting.\"\nIn this context may be placed Debussy's pantheistic eulogy to Nature, in a 1911 interview with Henry Malherbe:\nIn contrast to the \"impressionistic\" characterisation of Debussy's music, several writers have suggested that he structured at least some of his music on rigorous mathematical lines. In 1983 the pianist and scholar Roy Howat published a book contending that certain of Debussy's works are proportioned using mathematical models, even while using an apparent classical structure such as sonata form. Howat suggests that some of Debussy's pieces can be divided into sections that reflect the golden ratio, which is approximated by ratios of consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Simon Trezise, in his 1994 book \"Debussy: La Mer\", finds the intrinsic evidence \"remarkable\", with the caveat that no written or reported evidence suggests that Debussy deliberately sought such proportions. Lesure takes a similar view, endorsing Howat's conclusions while not taking a view on Debussy's conscious intentions.\nMusical idiom.\n Debussy wrote \"We must agree that the beauty of a work of art will always remain a mystery [...] we can never be absolutely sure 'how it's made.' We must at all costs preserve this magic which is peculiar to music and to which music, by its nature, is of all the arts the most receptive.\"\nNevertheless, there are many indicators of the sources and elements of Debussy's idiom. Writing in 1958, the critic Rudolph Reti summarised six features of Debussy's music, which he asserted \"established a new concept of tonality in European music\": the frequent use of lengthy pedal points \u2013 \"not merely bass pedals in the actual sense of the term, but sustained 'pedals' in any voice\"; glittering passages and webs of figurations which distract from occasional absence of tonality; frequent use of parallel chords which are \"in essence not harmonies at all, but rather 'chordal melodies', enriched unisons\", described by some writers as non-functional harmonies; bitonality, or at least bitonal chords; use of the whole-tone and pentatonic scales; and unprepared modulations, \"without any harmonic bridge\". Reti concludes that Debussy's achievement was the synthesis of monophonic based \"melodic tonality\" with harmonies, albeit different from those of \"harmonic tonality\".\nIn 1889, Debussy held conversations with his former teacher Guiraud, which included exploration of harmonic possibilities at the piano. The discussion, and Debussy's chordal keyboard improvisations, were noted by a younger pupil of Guiraud, Maurice Emmanuel. The chord sequences played by Debussy include some of the elements identified by Reti. They may also indicate the influence on Debussy of Satie's 1887 \"Trois Sarabandes\". A further improvisation by Debussy during this conversation included a sequence of whole tone harmonies which may have been inspired by the music of Glinka or Rimsky-Korsakov which was becoming known in Paris at this time. During the conversation, Debussy told Guiraud, \"There is no theory. You have only to listen. Pleasure is the law!\" \u2013 although he also conceded, \"I feel free because I have been through the mill, and I don't write in the fugal style because I know it.\"\nInfluences.\nMusical.\nAmong French predecessors, Chabrier was an important influence on Debussy (as he was on Ravel and Poulenc); Howat has written that Chabrier's piano music such as \"Sous-bois\" and \"Mauresque\" in the \"Pi\u00e8ces pittoresques\" explored new sound-worlds of which Debussy made effective use 30 years later. Lesure finds traces of Gounod and Massenet in some of Debussy's early songs, and remarks that it may have been from the Russians \u2013 Tchaikovsky, Balakirev, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and Mussorgsky \u2013 that Debussy acquired his taste for \"ancient and oriental modes and for vivid colorations, and a certain disdain for academic rules\". Lesure also considers that Mussorgsky's opera \"Boris Godunov\" directly influenced Debussy's \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\". In the music of Palestrina, Debussy found what he called \"a perfect whiteness\", and he felt that although Palestrina's musical forms had a \"strict manner\", they were more to his taste than the rigid rules prevailing among 19th-century French composers and teachers. He drew inspiration from what he called Palestrina's \"harmony created by melody\", finding an arabesque-like quality in the melodic lines.\nAlthough Debussy was in no doubt of Wagner's stature, he was only briefly influenced by him in his compositions, after \"La damoiselle \u00e9lue\" and the \"Cinq po\u00e8mes de Baudelaire\" (both begun in 1887). According to Pierre Lou\u00ffs, Debussy \"did not see 'what anyone can do beyond Tristan',\" although he admitted that it was sometimes difficult to avoid \"the ghost of old Klingsor, alias Richard Wagner, appearing at the turning of a bar\". After Debussy's short Wagnerian phase, he started to become interested in non-Western music and its unfamiliar approaches to composition. The piano piece \"Golliwogg's Cakewalk\", from the 1908 suite \"Children's Corner\", contains a parody of music from the introduction to \"Tristan\", in which, in the opinion of the musicologist Lawrence Kramer, Debussy escapes the shadow of the older composer and \"smilingly relativizes Wagner into insignificance\".\nA contemporary influence was Erik Satie, according to Nichols Debussy's \"most faithful friend\" amongst French musicians. Debussy's orchestration in 1896 of Satie's \"Gymnop\u00e9dies\" (which had been written in 1887) \"put their composer on the map\" according to the musicologist Richard Taruskin, and the Sarabande from Debussy's \"Pour le piano\" (1901) \"shows that [Debussy] knew Satie's \"Trois Sarabandes\" at a time when only a personal friend of the composer could have known them.\" (They were not published until 1911). Debussy's interest in the popular music of his time is evidenced not only by the \"Golliwogg's Cakewalk\" and other piano pieces featuring rag-time, such as \"The Little Nigar\" (Debussy's spelling) (1909), but by the slow waltz \"La plus que lente\" (\"The more than slow\"), based on the style of the gipsy violinist at a Paris hotel (to whom he gave the manuscript of the piece).\nIn addition to the composers who influenced his own compositions, Debussy held strong views about several others. He was for the most part enthusiastic about Richard Strauss and Stravinsky, respectful of Mozart and was in awe of Bach, whom he called the \"good God of music\" ({{Lang|fr|le Bon Dieu de la musique}}).{{refn|He remarked to a colleague that if Wagner, Mozart and Beethoven could come to his door and ask him to play \"Pell\u00e9as\" to them, he would gladly do so, but if it were Bach, he would be too in awe to dare.|group= n}} His relationship to Beethoven was complex; he was said to refer to him as {{Lang|fr|le vieux sourd}} ('the old deaf one') and asked one young pupil not to play Beethoven's music for \"it is like somebody dancing on my grave;\" but he believed that Beethoven had profound things to say, yet did not know how to say them, \"because he was imprisoned in a web of incessant restatement and of German aggressiveness.\" He was not in sympathy with Schubert, Schumann, Brahms and Mendelssohn, the latter being described as a \"facile and elegant notary\".\nWith the advent of the First World War, Debussy became ardently patriotic in his musical opinions. Writing to Stravinsky, he asked \"How could we not have foreseen that these men were plotting the destruction of our art, just as they had planned the destruction of our country?\" In 1915 he complained that \"since Rameau we have had no purely French tradition [...] We tolerated overblown orchestras, tortuous forms [...] we were about to give the seal of approval to even more suspect naturalizations when the sound of gunfire put a sudden stop to it all.\" Taruskin writes that some have seen this as a reference to the composers Gustav Mahler and Arnold Schoenberg, both born Jewish. In 1912 Debussy had remarked to his publisher of the opera \"Ariane et Barbe-bleue\" by the (also Jewish) composer Paul Dukas, \"You're right, [it] is a masterpiece \u2013 but it's not a masterpiece of French music.\"\nLiterary.\nDespite his lack of formal schooling, Debussy read widely and found inspiration in literature. Lesure writes, \"The development of free verse in poetry and the disappearance of the subject or model in painting influenced him to think about issues of musical form.\" Debussy was influenced by the Symbolist poets. These writers, who included Verlaine, Mallarm\u00e9, Maeterlinck and Rimbaud, reacted against the realism, naturalism, objectivity and formal conservatism that prevailed in the 1870s. They favoured poetry using suggestion rather than direct statement; the literary scholar Chris Baldrick writes that they evoked \"subjective moods through the use of private symbols, while avoiding the description of external reality or the expression of opinion\". Debussy was much in sympathy with the Symbolists' desire to bring poetry closer to music, became friendly with several leading exponents, and set many Symbolist works throughout his career.\nDebussy's literary inspirations were mostly French, but he did not overlook foreign writers. As well as Maeterlinck for \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\", he drew on Shakespeare and Dickens for two of his Pr\u00e9ludes for piano \u2013 \"La Danse de Puck\" (Book 1, 1910) and \"Hommage \u00e0 S. Pickwick Esq. P.P.M.P.C.\" (Book 2, 1913). He set Dante Gabriel Rossetti's \"The Blessed Damozel\" in his early cantata, \"La Damoiselle \u00e9lue\" (1888). He wrote incidental music for \"King Lear\" and planned an opera based on \"As You Like It\", but abandoned that once he turned his attention to setting Maeterlinck's play. In 1890 he began work on an orchestral piece inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" and later sketched the libretto for an opera, \"La chute de la maison Usher\". Another project inspired by Poe \u2013 an operatic version of \"The Devil in the Belfry\" did not progress beyond sketches. French writers whose words he set include Paul Bourget, Alfred de Musset, Th\u00e9odore de Banville, Leconte de Lisle, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, Paul Verlaine, Fran\u00e7ois Villon, and Mallarm\u00e9 \u2013 the last of whom also provided Debussy with the inspiration for one of his most popular orchestral pieces, \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\".\nInfluence on later composers.\nDebussy is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. Roger Nichols writes that \"if one omits Schoenberg [...] a list of 20th-century composers influenced by Debussy is practically a list of 20th-century composers \"tout court\".\"\nBart\u00f3k first encountered Debussy's music in 1907 and later said that \"Debussy's great service to music was to reawaken among all musicians an awareness of harmony and its possibilities\". Not only Debussy's use of whole-tone scales, but also his style of word-setting in \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\", were the subject of study by Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek while he was writing his 1921 opera \"K\u00e1\u0165a Kabanov\u00e1\". Stravinsky was more ambivalent about Debussy's music (he thought \"Pell\u00e9as\" \"a terrible bore\u00a0... in spite of many wonderful pages\") but the two composers knew each other and Stravinsky's \"Symphonies of Wind Instruments\" (1920) was written as a memorial for Debussy.\nIn the aftermath of the First World War, the young French composers of Les Six reacted against what they saw as the poetic, mystical quality of Debussy's music in favour of something more hard-edged. Their sympathiser and self-appointed spokesman Jean Cocteau wrote in 1918: \"Enough of \"nuages\", waves, aquariums, \"ondines\" and nocturnal perfumes,\" pointedly alluding to the titles of pieces by Debussy. Later generations of French composers had a much more positive relationship with his music. Messiaen was given a score of \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" as a boy and said that it was \"a revelation, love at first sight\" and \"probably the most decisive influence I have been subject to\". Boulez also discovered Debussy's music at a young age and said that it gave him his first sense of what modernity in music could mean.\nAmong contemporary composers George Benjamin has described \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\" as \"the definition of perfection\"; he has conducted \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" and the critic Rupert Christiansen detects the influence of the work in Benjamin's opera \"Written on Skin\" (2012). Others have made orchestrations of some of the piano and vocal works, including John Adams's version of four of the Baudelaire songs (\"Le Livre de Baudelaire\", 1994), Robin Holloway's of \"En blanc et noir\" (2002), and Colin Matthews's of both books of \"Pr\u00e9ludes\" (2001\u20132006).\nRecordings.\nIn 1904, Debussy played the piano accompaniment for Mary Garden in recordings for the Compagnie fran\u00e7aise du Gramophone of four of his songs: three \"m\u00e9lodies\" from the Verlaine cycle \"Ariettes oubli\u00e9es\" \u2013 \"Il pleure dans mon coeur\", \"L'ombre des arbres\" and \"Green\" \u2013 and \"Mes longs cheveux\", from Act III of \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\". He made a set of piano rolls for the Welte-Mignon company in 1913. They contain fourteen of his pieces: \"D'un cahier d'esquisses\", \"La plus que lente\", \"La soir\u00e9e dans Grenade\", all six movements of \"Children's Corner\", and five of the \"Preludes\": \"Danseuses de Delphes\", \"Le vent dans la plaine\", \"La cath\u00e9drale engloutie\", \"La danse de Puck\" and \"Minstrels\". The 1904 and 1913 sets have been transferred to compact disc.\nContemporaries of Debussy who made recordings of his music included the pianists Ricardo Vi\u00f1es (in \"Poissons d'or\" from \"Images\" and \"La soir\u00e9e dans Grenade\" from \"Estampes\"); Alfred Cortot (numerous solo pieces as well as the Violin Sonata with Jacques Thibaud and the \"Chansons de Bilitis\" with Maggie Teyte); and Marguerite Long (\"Jardins sous la pluie\" and \"Arabesques\"). Singers in Debussy's m\u00e9lodies or excerpts from \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\" included Jane Bathori, Claire Croiza, Charles Panz\u00e9ra and Ninon Vallin; and among the conductors in the major orchestral works were Ernest Ansermet, D\u00e9sir\u00e9-\u00c9mile Inghelbrecht, Pierre Monteux and Arturo Toscanini, and in the \"Petite Suite\", Henri B\u00fcsser, who had prepared the orchestration for Debussy. Many of these early recordings have been reissued on CD.\nIn more recent times Debussy's output has been extensively recorded. In 2018, to mark the centenary of the composer's death, Warner Classics, with contributions from other companies, issued a 33-CD set that is claimed to include all the music Debussy wrote."}

The word \"imperialism\" describes practices in which a country engages culture (language, tradition, and ritual, politics, economics) to create and maintain unequal social and economic relationships among social groups. Cultural imperialism often uses wealth, media power and violence to implement the system of cultural hegemony that legitimizes imperialism.\nCultural imperialism may take various forms, such as an attitude, a formal policy, or military action\u2014insofar as each of these reinforces the empire's cultural hegemony. Research on the topic occurs in scholarly disciplines, and is especially prevalent in communication and media studies, education, foreign policy, history, international relations, linguistics, literature, post-colonialism, science, sociology, social theory, environmentalism, and sports.\nBackground and definitions.\nAlthough the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" has a 1921 reference to the \"cultural imperialism of the Russians\", John Tomlinson, in his book on the subject, writes that the term emerged in the 1960s and has been a focus of research since at least the 1970s. Terms such as \"media imperialism\", \"structural imperialism\", \"cultural dependency and domination\", \"cultural synchronization\", \"electronic colonialism\", \"ideological imperialism\", and \"economic imperialism\" have all been used to describe the same basic notion of cultural imperialism.\nThe term refers largely to the exercise of power in a cultural relationship in which the principles, ideas, practices, and values of a powerful, invading society are imposed upon indigenous cultures in the occupied areas. The process is often used to describe examples of when the compulsory practices of the cultural traditions of the imperial social group are implemented upon a conquered social group. The process is also present when powerful nations are able to flood the information and media space with their ideas, limiting countries and communities ability to compete and expose people to locally created content. \nCultural imperialism has been called a process that intends to transition the \"cultural symbols of the invading communities from 'foreign' to 'natural,\"domestic,'\" comments Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera. The process of Cultural Conquest often involves three discrete and sequential phases:\n(Herlihy-Mera, Jeffrey. 2018. \"After American Studies: Rethinking the Legacies of Transnational Exceptionalism.\" Routledge. p. 24)\nWhile the third phase continues \"in perpetuity\", cultural imperialism tends to be \"gradual, contested (and continues to be contested), and is by nature incomplete. The partial and imperfect configuration of this ontology takes an implicit conceptualization of reality and attempts\u2014and often fails\u2014to elide other forms of collective existence.\" In order to achieve that end, cultural engineering projects strive to \"isolate residents within constructed spheres of symbols\" such that they (eventually, in some cases after several generations) abandon other cultures and identify with the new symbols. \"The broader intended outcome of these interventions might be described as a common recognition of \"possession\" of the land itself (on behalf of the organizations publishing and financing the images).\"\nFor Herbert Schiller, cultural imperialism refers to the American Empire's \"coercive and persuasive agencies, and their capacity to promote and universalize an American 'way of life' in other countries without any reciprocation of influence.\" According to Schiller, cultural imperialism \"pressured, forced and bribed\" societies to integrate with the U.S.'s expansive capitalist model but also incorporated them with attraction and persuasion by winning \"the mutual consent, even solicitation of the indigenous rulers.\" He continues remarks that it is:the sum processes by which a society is brought into the modern [U.S.-centered] world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centres of the system. The public media are the foremost example of operating enterprises that are used in the penetrative process. For penetration on a significant scale the media themselves must be captured by the dominating/penetrating power. This occurs largely through the commercialization of broadcasting.The historical contexts, iterations, complexities, and politics of Schiller's foundational and substantive theorization of cultural imperialism in international communication and media studies are discussed in detail by political economy of communication researchers Richard Maxwell, Vincent Mosco, Graham Murdock, and Tanner Mirrlees.\nDowning and Sreberny-Mohammadi state: \"Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force. In the history of colonialism, (i.e., the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreigners), the educational and media systems of many Third World countries have been set up as replicas of those in Britain, France, or the United States and carry their values. Western advertising has made further inroads, as have architectural and fashion styles. Subtly but powerfully, the message has often been insinuated that Western cultures are superior to the cultures of the Third World.\"\nPoststructuralism.\nWithin the realm of poststructuralist and postcolonial theory, \"cultural imperialism\" can be seen as the cultural legacy of Western colonialism, or forms of social action contributing to the continuation of Western hegemony. To some outside of the realm of this discourse, the term is critiqued as being unclear, unfocused, and/or contradictory in nature.\nThe work of French philosopher and social theorist Michel Foucault has heavily influenced use of the term \"cultural imperialism,\" particularly his philosophical interpretation of power and his concept of governmentality. Following an interpretation of power similar to that of Machiavelli, Foucault defines power as immaterial, as a \"certain type of relation between individuals\" that has to do with complex strategic social positions that relate to the subject's ability to control its environment and influence those around itself. According to Foucault, power is intimately tied with his conception of truth. \"Truth\", as he defines it, is a \"system of ordered procedures for the production, regulation, distribution, circulation, and operation of statements\" which has a \"circular relation\" with systems of power. Therefore, inherent in systems of power, is always \"truth\", which is culturally specific, inseparable from ideology which often coincides with various forms of hegemony. \"Cultural imperialism\" may be an example of this.\nFoucault's interpretation of governance is also very important in constructing theories of transnational power structure. In his lectures at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, Foucault often defines governmentality as the broad art of \"governing\", which goes beyond the traditional conception of governance in terms of state mandates, and into other realms such as governing \"a household, souls, children, a province, a convent, a religious order, a family\". This relates directly back to Machiavelli's treatise on how to retain political power at any cost, \"The Prince\", and Foucault's aforementioned conceptions of truth and power. (i.e. various subjectivities are created through power relations that are culturally specific, which lead to various forms of culturally specific governmentality such as neoliberal governmentality.)\nPost-Colonialism.\nEdward Sa\u00efd is a founding figure of postcolonialism, established with the book \"Orientalism\" (1978), a humanist critique of The Enlightenment, which criticises Western knowledge of \"The East\"\u2014specifically the English and the French constructions of what is and what is not \"Oriental\". Whereby said \"knowledge\" then led to cultural tendencies towards a binary opposition of the Orient vs. the Occident, wherein one concept is defined in opposition to the other concept, and from which they emerge as of unequal value. In \"Culture and Imperialism\" (1993), the sequel to \"Orientalism\", Sa\u00efd proposes that, despite the formal end of the \"age of empire\" after the Second World War (1939\u20131945), colonial imperialism left a cultural legacy to the (previously) colonised peoples, which remains in their contemporary civilisations; and that said American \"cultural imperialism\" is very influential in the international systems of power.\nIn \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak critiques common representations in the West of the Sati, as being controlled by authors other than the participants (specifically English colonizers and Hindu leaders). Because of this, Spivak argues that the subaltern, referring to the communities that participate in the Sati, are not able to represent themselves through their own voice. Spivak says that cultural imperialism has the power to disqualify or erase the knowledge and mode of education of certain populations that are low on the social hierarchy.\nIn \"A Critique of Postcolonial Reason\", Spivak argues that Western philosophy has a history of not only exclusion of the subaltern from discourse, but also does not allow them to occupy the space of a fully human subject.\nContemporary ideas and debate.\n\"Cultural imperialism\" can refer to either the forced acculturation of a subject population, or to the voluntary embracing of a foreign culture by individuals who do so of their own free will. Since these are two very different referents, the validity of the term has been called into question.\nCultural influence can be seen by the \"receiving\" culture as either a threat to or an enrichment of its cultural identity. It seems therefore useful to distinguish between cultural imperialism as an (active or passive) attitude of superiority, and the position of a culture or group that seeks to complement its own cultural production, considered partly deficient, with imported products.\nThe imported products or services can themselves represent, or be associated with, certain values (such as consumerism). According to one argument, the \"receiving\" culture does not necessarily perceive this link, but instead absorbs the foreign culture passively through the use of the foreign goods and services. Due to its somewhat concealed, but very potent nature, this hypothetical idea is described by some experts as \"banal imperialism\". For example, it is argued that while \"American companies are accused of wanting to control 95 percent of the world's consumers\", \"cultural imperialism involves much more than simple consumer goods; it involved the dissemination of American principles such as freedom and democracy\", a process which \"may sound appealing\" but which \"masks a frightening truth: many cultures around the world are disappearing due to the overwhelming influence of corporate and cultural America\".\nSome believe that the newly globalised economy of the late 20th and early 21st century has facilitated this process through the use of new information technology. This kind of cultural imperialism is derived from what is called \"soft power\". The theory of electronic colonialism extends the issue to global cultural issues and the impact of major multi-media conglomerates, ranging from Paramount, WarnerMedia, AT&amp;T, Disney, News Corp, to Google and Microsoft with the focus on the hegemonic power of these mainly United States-based communication giants.\nCultural diversity.\nOne of the reasons often given for opposing any form of cultural imperialism, voluntary or otherwise, is the preservation of cultural diversity, a goal seen by some as analogous to the preservation of ecological diversity. Proponents of this idea argue either that such diversity is valuable in itself, to preserve human historical heritage and knowledge, or instrumentally valuable because it makes available more ways of solving problems and responding to catastrophes, natural or otherwise.\nIdeas relating to African colonisation.\nOf all the areas of the world that scholars have claimed to be adversely affected by imperialism, Africa is probably the most notable. In the expansive \"age of imperialism\" of the nineteenth century, scholars have argued that European colonisation in Africa has led to the elimination of many various cultures, worldviews, and epistemologies, particularly through neocolonisation of public education. This, arguably has led to uneven development, and further informal forms of social control having to do with culture and imperialism. A variety of factors, scholars argue, lead to the elimination of cultures, worldviews, and epistemologies, such as \"de-linguicization\" (replacing native African languages with European ones), devaluing ontologies that are not explicitly individualistic, and at times going as far as to not only define Western culture itself as science, but that non-Western approaches to science, the Arts, indigenous culture, etc. are not even knowledge. One scholar, Ali A. Abdi, claims that imperialism inherently \"involve[s] extensively interactive regimes and heavy contexts of identity deformation, misrecognition, loss of self-esteem, and individual and social doubt in self-efficacy.\" Therefore, all imperialism would always, already be cultural.\nTies to neoliberalism.\nNeoliberalism is often critiqued by sociologists, anthropologists, and cultural studies scholars as being culturally imperialistic. Critics of neoliberalism, at times, claim that it is the newly predominant form of imperialism. Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Dunn and Julia Elyachar have claimed that neoliberalism requires and creates its own form of governmentality.\nIn Dunn's work, \"Privatizing Poland\", she argues that the expansion of the multinational corporation, Gerber, into Poland in the 1990s imposed Western, neoliberal governmentality, ideologies, and epistemologies upon the post-soviet persons hired. Cultural conflicts occurred most notably the company's inherent individualistic policies, such as promoting competition among workers rather than cooperation, and in its strong opposition to what the company owners claimed was bribery.\nIn Elyachar's work, \"Markets of Dispossession\", she focuses on ways in which, in Cairo, NGOs along with INGOs and the state promoted neoliberal governmentality through schemas of economic development that relied upon \"youth microentrepreneurs\". Youth microentrepreneurs would receive small loans to build their own businesses, similar to the way that microfinance supposedly operates. Elyachar argues though, that these programs not only were a failure, but that they shifted cultural opinions of value (personal and cultural) in a way that favoured Western ways of thinking and being.\nTies to development studies.\nOften, methods of promoting development and social justice are critiqued as being imperialistic in a cultural sense. For example, Chandra Mohanty has critiqued Western feminism, claiming that it has created a misrepresentation of the \"third world woman\" as being completely powerless, unable to resist male dominance. Thus, this leads to the often critiqued narrative of the \"white man\" saving the \"brown woman\" from the \"brown man\". Other, more radical critiques of development studies, have to do with the field of study itself. Some scholars even question the intentions of those developing the field of study, claiming that efforts to \"develop\" the Global South were never about the South itself. Instead, these efforts, it is argued, were made in order to advance Western development and reinforce Western hegemony.\nTies to media effects studies.\nThe core of cultural imperialism thesis is integrated with the political-economy traditional approach in media effects research. Critics of cultural imperialism commonly claim that non-Western cultures, particularly from the Third World, will forsake their traditional values and lose their cultural identities when they are solely exposed to Western media. Nonetheless, Michael B. Salwen, in his book \"Critical Studies in Mass Communication\" (1991), claims that cross-consideration and integration of empirical findings on cultural imperialist influences is very critical in terms of understanding mass media in the international sphere. He recognises both of contradictory contexts on cultural imperialist impacts. \nThe first context is where cultural imperialism imposes socio-political disruptions on developing nations. Western media can distort images of foreign cultures and provoke personal and social conflicts to developing nations in some cases. \nAnother context is that peoples in developing nations resist to foreign media and preserve their cultural attitudes. Although he admits that outward manifestations of Western culture may be adopted, but the fundamental values and behaviours remain still. Furthermore, positive effects might occur when male-dominated cultures adopt the \"liberation\" of women with exposure to Western media and it stimulates ample exchange of cultural exchange.\nCriticisms of \"cultural imperialism theory\".\nCritics of scholars who discuss cultural imperialism have a number of critiques. \"Cultural imperialism\" is a term that is only used in discussions where cultural relativism and constructivism are generally taken as true. (One cannot critique promoting Western values if one believes that said values are absolutely correct. Similarly, one cannot argue that Western epistemology is unjustly promoted in non-Western societies if one believes that those epistemologies are absolutely correct.) Therefore, those who disagree with cultural relativism and/or constructivism may critique the employment of the term, \"cultural imperialism\" on those terms.\nJohn Tomlinson provides a critique of cultural imperialism theory and reveals major problems in the way in which the idea of cultural, as opposed to economic or political, imperialism is formulated. In his book \"Cultural Imperialism: A Critical Introduction\", he delves into the much debated \"media imperialism\" theory. Summarizing research on the Third World's reception of American television shows, he challenges the cultural imperialism argument, conveying his doubts about the degree to which US shows in developing nations actually carry US values and improve the profits of US companies. Tomlinson suggests that cultural imperialism is growing in some respects, but local transformation and interpretations of imported media products propose that cultural diversification is not at an end in global society. He explains that one of the fundamental conceptual mistakes of cultural imperialism is to take for granted that the distribution of cultural goods can be considered as cultural dominance. He thus supports his argument highly criticising the concept that Americanization is occurring through global overflow of American television products. He points to a myriad of examples of television networks who have managed to dominate their domestic markets and that domestic programs generally top the ratings. He also doubts the concept that cultural agents are passive receivers of information. He states that movement between cultural/geographical areas always involves translation, mutation, adaptation, and the creation of hybridity.\nOther key critiques are that the term is not defined well, and employs further terms that are not defined well, and therefore lacks explanatory power, that \"cultural imperialism\" is hard to measure, and that the theory of a legacy of colonialism is not always true.\nRothkopf on dealing with cultural dominance.\nDavid Rothkopf, managing director of Kissinger Associates and an adjunct professor of international affairs at Columbia University (who also served as a senior U.S. Commerce Department official in the Clinton Administration), wrote about cultural imperialism in his provocatively titled \"In Praise of Cultural Imperialism?\" in the summer 1997 issue of \"Foreign Policy\" magazine. Rothkopf says that the United States should embrace \"cultural imperialism\" as in its self-interest. But his definition of cultural imperialism stresses spreading the values of tolerance and openness to cultural change in order to avoid war and conflict between cultures as well as expanding accepted technological and legal standards to provide free traders with enough security to do business with more countries. Rothkopf's definition almost exclusively involves allowing individuals in other nations to accept or reject foreign cultural influences. He also mentions, but only in passing, the use of the English language and consumption of news and popular music and film as cultural dominance that he supports. Rothkopf additionally makes the point that globalisation and the Internet are accelerating the process of cultural influence.\nCulture is sometimes used by the organisers of society\u2014politicians, theologians, academics, and families\u2014to impose and ensure order, the rudiments of which change over time as need dictates. One need only look at the 20th century's genocides. In each one, leaders used culture as a political front to fuel the passions of their armies and other minions and to justify their actions among their people.\nRothkopf then cites genocide and s in Armenia, Russia, the Holocaust, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda and East Timor as examples of culture (in some cases expressed in the ideology of \"political culture\" or religion) being misused to justify violence. He also acknowledges that cultural imperialism in the past has been guilty of forcefully eliminating the cultures of natives in the Americas and in Africa, or through use of the Inquisition, \"and during the expansion of virtually every empire.\" The most important way to deal with cultural influence in any nation, according to Rothkopf, is to promote tolerance and allow, or even promote, cultural diversities that are compatible with tolerance and to eliminate those cultural differences that cause violent conflict:\nSuccessful multicultural societies, be they nations, federations, or other conglomerations of closely interrelated states, discern those aspects of culture that do not threaten union, stability, or prosperity (such as food, holidays, rituals, and music) and allow them to flourish. But they counteract or eradicate the more subversive elements of culture (exclusionary aspects of religion, language, and political/ideological beliefs). History shows that bridging cultural gaps successfully and serving as a home to diverse peoples requires certain social structures, laws, and institutions that transcend culture. Furthermore, the history of a number of ongoing experiments in multiculturalism, such as in the European Union, India, South Africa, Canada and the United States, suggests that workable, if not perfected, integrative models exist. Each is built on the idea that tolerance is crucial to social well-being, and each at times has been threatened by both intolerance and a heightened emphasis on cultural distinctions. The greater public good warrants eliminating those cultural characteristics that promote conflict or prevent harmony, even as less-divisive, more personally observed cultural distinctions are celebrated and preserved.\nCultural dominance can also be seen in the 1930s in Australia where the Aboriginal Assimilation Policy acted as an attempt to wipe out the Native Australian people. The British settlers tried to biologically alter the skin colour of the Australian Aboriginal people through mixed breeding with white people. The policy also made attempts to forcefully conform the Aborigines to western ideas of dress and education.\nIn history.\nAlthough the term was popularised in the 1960s, and was used by its original proponents to refer to cultural hegemonies in a post-colonial world, cultural imperialism has also been used to refer to times further in the past.\nAncient Greece.\nThe Ancient Greeks are known for spreading their culture around the Mediterranean and Near East through trade and conquest. During the Archaic Period, the burgeoning Greek city-states established settlements and colonies across the Mediterranean Sea, especially in Sicily and southern Italy, influencing the Etruscan and Roman peoples of the region. In the late fourth century BC, Alexander the Great conquered Persian and Indian territories all the way to the Indus River Valley and Punjab, spreading Greek pagan religion, art, and science along the way. This resulted in the rise of Hellenistic kingdoms and cities across Egypt, the Near East, Central Asia, and Northwest India where Greek culture fused with the cultures of the indigenous peoples. The Greek influence prevailed even longer in science and literature, where medieval Muslim scholars in the Middle East studied the writings of Aristotle for scientific learning.\nAncient Rome.\nThe Roman Empire was also an early example of cultural imperialism.\nEarly Rome, in its conquest of Italy, assimilated the people of Etruria by replacing the Etruscan language with Latin, which led to the demise of that language and many aspects of Etruscan civilisation.\nCultural Romanization was imposed on many parts of Rome's empire by \"many regions receiving Roman culture unwillingly, as a form of cultural imperialism.\" For example, when Greece was conquered by the Roman armies, Rome set about altering the culture of Greece to conform with Roman ideals. For instance, the Greek habit of stripping naked, in public, for exercise, was looked on askance by Roman writers, who considered the practice to be a cause of the Greeks' effeminacy and enslavement. The Roman example has been linked to modern instances of European imperialism in African countries, bridging the two instances with Slavoj Zizek's discussions of 'empty signifiers'.\nThe Pax Romana was secured in the empire, in part, by the \"forced acculturation of the culturally diverse populations that Rome had conquered.\"\nBritish Empire.\nBritish worldwide expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries was an economic and political phenomenon. However, \"there was also a strong social and cultural dimension to it, which Rudyard Kipling termed the 'white man's burden'.\" One of the ways this was carried out was by religious proselytising, by, amongst others, the London Missionary Society, which was \"an agent of British cultural imperialism.\" Another way, was by the imposition of educational material on the colonies for an \"imperial curriculum\". Robin A. Butlin writes, \"The promotion of empire through books, illustrative materials, and educational syllabuses was widespread, part of an education policy geared to cultural imperialism\". This was also true of science and technology in the empire. Douglas M. Peers and Nandini Gooptu note that \"Most scholars of colonial science in India now prefer to stress the ways in which science and technology worked in the service of colonialism, as both a 'tool of empire' in the practical sense and as a vehicle for cultural imperialism. In other words, science developed in India in ways that reflected colonial priorities, tending to benefit Europeans at the expense of Indians, while remaining dependent on and subservient to scientific authorities in the colonial metropolis.\"\nThe analysis of cultural imperialism carried out by Edward Said drew principally from a study of the British Empire. According to Danilo Raponi, the cultural imperialism of the British in the 19th century had a much wider effect than only in the British Empire. He writes, \"To paraphrase Said, I see cultural imperialism as a complex cultural hegemony of a country, Great Britain, that in the 19th century had no rivals in terms of its ability to project its power across the world and to influence the cultural, political and commercial affairs of most countries. It is the 'cultural hegemony' of a country whose power to export the most fundamental ideas and concepts at the basis of its understanding of 'civilisation' knew practically no bounds.\" In this, for example, Raponi includes Italy.\nOther pre-Second World War examples.\nThe New Cambridge Modern History writes about the cultural imperialism of Napoleonic France. Napoleon used the Institut de France \"as an instrument for transmuting French universalism into cultural imperialism.\" Members of the Institute (who included Napoleon), descended upon Egypt in 1798. \"Upon arrival they organised themselves into an Institute of Cairo. The Rosetta Stone is their most famous find. The science of Egyptology is their legacy.\"\nAfter the First World War, Germans were worried about the extent of French influence in the annexed Rhineland, with the French occupation of the Ruhr Valley in 1923. An early use of the term appeared in an essay by Paul Ruhlmann (as \"Peter Hartmann\") at that date, entitled \"French Cultural Imperialism on the Rhine\".\nTies to North American Colonisation.\nKeeping in line with the trends of international imperialistic endeavours, the expansion of Canadian and American territory in the 19th century saw cultural imperialism employed as a means of control over indigenous populations. This, when used in conjunction of more traditional forms of ethnic cleansing and genocide in the United States, saw devastating, lasting effects on indigenous communities.\nIn 2017 Canada celebrated its 150-year anniversary of the confederating of three British colonies. As Catherine Murton Stoehr points out in \"Origins\", a publication organised by the history departments of Ohio State University and Miami University, the occasion came with remembrance of Canada's treatment of First Nations people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A mere 9 years after the 1867 signing of confederation Canada passed \"The Indian Act\", a separate and not equal form of government especially for First Nations. The Indian Act remains in place today, confining and constraining Indigenous jurisdiction in every area of life, in direct contravention of the nation's founding treaties with indigenous nations.\nNumerous policies focused on indigenous persons came into effect shortly thereafter. Most notable is the use of residential schools across Canada as a means to remove indigenous persons from their culture and instill in them the beliefs and values of the majorised colonial hegemony. The policies of these schools, as described by Ward Churchill in his book \"Kill the Indian, Save the Man\", were to forcefully assimilate students who were often removed with force from their families. These schools forbid students from using their native languages and participating in their own cultural practices.\nResidential schools were largely run by Christian churches, operating in conjunction with Christian missions with minimal government oversight.\nThe book, \"Stolen Lives: The Indigenous peoples of Canada and the Indian Residentials Schools\", describes this form of operation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The government provided little leadership, and the clergy in charge were left to decide what to teach and how to teach it. Their priority was to impart the teachings of their church or order\u2014not to provide a good education that could help students in their post-graduation lives.\nIn a \"New York Times\" op-ed, Gabrielle Scrimshaw describes her grandparents being forced to send her mother to one of these schools or risk imprisonment. After hiding her mother on \"school pick up day\" so as to avoid sending their daughter to institutions whose abuse was well known at the time (mid-20th century). Scrimshaw's mother was left with limited options for further education she says and is today illiterate as a result.\nScrimshaw explains, \"Seven generations of my ancestors went through these schools. Each new family member enrolled meant a compounding of abuse and a steady loss of identity, culture and hope. My mother was the last generation. the experience left her broken, and like so many, she turned to substances to numb these pains.\"\nA report, republished by CBC News, estimates nearly 6,000 children died in the care of these schools.\nThe colonisation of native peoples in North America remains active today despite the closing of the majority of residential schools. This form of cultural imperialism continues in the use of Native Americans as mascots for schools and athletic teams. Jason Edward Black, a professor and chair in the Department of Communication Studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, describes how the use of Native Americans as mascots furthers the colonial attitudes of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Indigenous groups, along with cultural studies scholars, view the Native mascots as hegemonic devices\u2013commodification tools\u2013that advance a contemporary manifest destiny by marketing Native culture as Euromerican identity.\nIn \"Deciphering Pocahontas\", Kent Ono and Derek Buescher wrote: \"Euro-American culture has made a habit of appropriating, and redefining what is 'distinctive' and constitutive of Native Americans.\"\nNazi colonialism.\n\"Cultural imperialism\" has also been used in connection with the expansion of German influence under the Nazis in the middle of the twentieth century. Alan Steinweis and Daniel Rogers note that even before the Nazis came to power, \"Already in the Weimar Republic, German academic specialists on eastern Europe had contributed through their publications and teaching to the legitimization of German territorial revanchism and cultural imperialism. These scholars operated primarily in the disciplines of history, economics, geography, and literature.\"\nIn the area of music, Michael Kater writes that during the WWII German occupation of France, Hans Rosbaud, a German conductor based by the Nazi regime in Strasbourg, became \"at least nominally, a servant of Nazi cultural imperialism directed against the French.\"\nIn Italy during the war, Germany pursued \"a European cultural front that gravitates around German culture\". The Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels set up the European Union of Writers, \"one of Goebbels's most ambitious projects for Nazi cultural hegemony. Presumably a means of gathering authors from Germany, Italy, and the occupied countries to plan the literary life of the new Europe, the union soon emerged as a vehicle of German cultural imperialism.\"\nFor other parts of Europe, Robert Gerwarth, writing about cultural imperialism and Reinhard Heydrich, states that the \"Nazis' Germanization project was based on a historically unprecedented programme of racial stock-taking, theft, expulsion and murder.\" Also, \"The full integration of the [Czech] Protectorate into this New Order required the complete Germanization of the Protectorate's cultural life and the eradication of indigenous Czech and Jewish culture.\"\nThe actions by Nazi Germany reflect on the notion of race and culture playing a significant role in imperialism. The idea that there is a distinction between the Germans and the Jews has created the illusion of Germans believing they were superior to the Jewish inferiors, the notion of us/them and self/others.\nWestern imperialism.\nCultural imperialism manifests in the Western world in the form legal system to include commodification and marketing of indigenous resources (example medicinal, spiritual or artistic) and genetic resources (example human DNA).\nAmericanization.\nThe terms \"McDonaldization\", \"Disneyization\" and \"Cocacolonization\" have been coined to describe the spread of Western cultural influence.\nThere are many countries affected by the US and their pop-culture. For example, the film industry in Nigeria referred to as \"Nollywood\" being the second largest as it produces more films annually than the United States, their films are shown across Africa. Another term that describes the spread of Western cultural influence is it is when American culture is promoted through Hollywood films which can culturally affect the viewers of Hollywood films.\nSee also.\nsoft power\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "6271", "revid": "39680754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6271", "title": "Chemical reaction", "text": "Process that results in the interconversion of chemical species\nA chemical reaction is a process that leads to the chemical transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes can occur.\nThe substance (or substances) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change, and they yield one or more products, which usually have properties different from the reactants. Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called elementary reactions, and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism. Chemical reactions are described with chemical equations, which symbolically present the starting materials, end products, and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions.\nChemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration. Typically, reaction rates increase with increasing temperature because there is more thermal energy available to reach the activation energy necessary for breaking bonds between atoms.\nA reaction may be classified as redox in which oxidation and reduction occur or non-redox in which there is no oxidation and reduction occurring. Most simple redox reactions may be classified as a combination, decomposition, or single displacement reaction.\nDifferent chemical reactions are used during chemical synthesis in order to obtain the desired product. In biochemistry, a consecutive series of chemical reactions (where the product of one reaction is the reactant of the next reaction) form metabolic pathways. These reactions are often catalyzed by protein enzymes. Enzymes increase the rates of biochemical reactions, so that metabolic syntheses and decompositions impossible under ordinary conditions can occur at the temperature and concentrations present within a cell.\nThe general concept of a chemical reaction has been extended to reactions between entities smaller than atoms, including nuclear reactions, radioactive decays and reactions between elementary particles, as described by quantum field theory.\nHistory.\nChemical reactions such as combustion in fire, fermentation and the reduction of ores to metals were known since antiquity. Initial theories of transformation of materials were developed by Greek philosophers, such as the Four-Element Theory of Empedocles stating that any substance is composed of the four basic elements \u2013 fire, water, air and earth. In the Middle Ages, chemical transformations were studied by alchemists. They attempted, in particular, to convert lead into gold, for which purpose they used reactions of lead and lead-copper alloys with sulfur.\nThe artificial production of chemical substances already was a central goal for medieval alchemists. Examples include the synthesis of ammonium chloride from organic substances as described in the works (c. 850\u2013950) attributed to J\u0101bir ibn \u1e24ayy\u0101n, or the production of mineral acids such as sulfuric and nitric acids by later alchemists, starting from c. 1300. The production of mineral acids involved the heating of sulfate and nitrate minerals such as copper sulfate, alum and saltpeter. In the 17th century, Johann Rudolph Glauber produced hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfate by reacting sulfuric acid and sodium chloride. With the development of the lead chamber process in 1746 and the Leblanc process, allowing large-scale production of sulfuric acid and sodium carbonate, respectively, chemical reactions became implemented into the industry. Further optimization of sulfuric acid technology resulted in the contact process in the 1880s, and the Haber process was developed in 1909\u20131910 for ammonia synthesis.\nFrom the 16th century, researchers including Jan Baptist van Helmont, Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton tried to establish theories of experimentally observed chemical transformations. The phlogiston theory was proposed in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher. It postulated the existence of a fire-like element called \"phlogiston\", which was contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion. This proved to be false in 1785 by Antoine Lavoisier who found the correct explanation of the combustion as a reaction with oxygen from the air.\nJoseph Louis Gay-Lussac recognized in 1808 that gases always react in a certain relationship with each other. Based on this idea and the atomic theory of John Dalton, Joseph Proust had developed the law of definite proportions, which later resulted in the concepts of stoichiometry and chemical equations.\nRegarding the organic chemistry, it was long believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were too complex to be obtained synthetically. According to the concept of vitalism, organic matter was endowed with a \"vital force\" and distinguished from inorganic materials. This separation was ended however by the synthesis of urea from inorganic precursors by Friedrich W\u00f6hler in 1828. Other chemists who brought major contributions to organic chemistry include Alexander William Williamson with his synthesis of ethers and Christopher Kelk Ingold, who, among many discoveries, established the mechanisms of substitution reactions.\nCharacteristics.\nThe general characteristics of chemical reactions are:\nEquations.\nChemical equations are used to graphically illustrate chemical reactions. They consist of chemical or structural formulas of the reactants on the left and those of the products on the right. They are separated by an arrow (\u2192) which indicates the direction and type of the reaction; the arrow is read as the word \"yields\". The tip of the arrow points in the direction in which the reaction proceeds. A double arrow (\u21cc) pointing in opposite directions is used for equilibrium reactions. Equations should be balanced according to the stoichiometry, the number of atoms of each species should be the same on both sides of the equation. This is achieved by scaling the number of involved molecules (A, B, C and D in a schematic example below) by the appropriate integers \"a, b, c\" and \"d\".\nMore elaborate reactions are represented by reaction schemes, which in addition to starting materials and products show important intermediates or transition states. Also, some relatively minor additions to the reaction can be indicated above the reaction arrow; examples of such additions are water, heat, illumination, a catalyst, etc. Similarly, some minor products can be placed below the arrow, often with a minus sign.\nRetrosynthetic analysis can be applied to design a complex synthesis reaction. Here the analysis starts from the products, for example by splitting selected chemical bonds, to arrive at plausible initial reagents. A special arrow (\u21d2) is used in retro reactions.\nElementary reactions.\nThe elementary reaction is the smallest division into which a chemical reaction can be decomposed, it has no intermediate products. Most experimentally observed reactions are built up from many elementary reactions that occur in parallel or sequentially. The actual sequence of the individual elementary reactions is known as reaction mechanism. An elementary reaction involves a few molecules, usually one or two, because of the low probability for several molecules to meet at a certain time.\nThe most important elementary reactions are unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. Only one molecule is involved in a unimolecular reaction; it is transformed by isomerization or a dissociation into one or more other molecules. Such reactions require the addition of energy in the form of heat or light. A typical example of a unimolecular reaction is the cis\u2013trans isomerization, in which the cis-form of a compound converts to the trans-form or vice versa.\nIn a typical dissociation reaction, a bond in a molecule splits (ruptures) resulting in two molecular fragments. The splitting can be homolytic or heterolytic. In the first case, the bond is divided so that each product retains an electron and becomes a neutral radical. In the second case, both electrons of the chemical bond remain with one of the products, resulting in charged ions. Dissociation plays an important role in triggering chain reactions, such as hydrogen\u2013oxygen or polymerization reactions.\n&lt;chem&gt;AB -&gt; A + B&lt;/chem&gt;\nFor bimolecular reactions, two molecules collide and react with each other. Their merger is called chemical synthesis or an addition reaction.\n&lt;chem&gt;A + B -&gt; AB&lt;/chem&gt;\nAnother possibility is that only a portion of one molecule is transferred to the other molecule. This type of reaction occurs, for example, in redox and acid-base reactions. In redox reactions, the transferred particle is an electron, whereas in acid-base reactions it is a proton. This type of reaction is also called metathesis.\n&lt;chem&gt;HA + B -&gt; A + HB&lt;/chem&gt;\nfor example\n&lt;chem&gt;NaCl + AgNO3 -&gt; NaNO3 + AgCl(v)&lt;/chem&gt;\nChemical equilibrium.\nMost chemical reactions are reversible; that is, they can and do run in both directions. The forward and reverse reactions are competing with each other and differ in reaction rates. These rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with the time of the reaction: the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction, establishing the so-called chemical equilibrium. The time to reach equilibrium depends on parameters such as temperature, pressure, and the materials involved, and is determined by the minimum free energy. In equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy must be zero. The pressure dependence can be explained with the Le Chatelier's principle. For example, an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with fewer moles of gas.\nThe reaction yield stabilizes at equilibrium but can be increased by removing the product from the reaction mixture or changed by increasing the temperature or pressure. A change in the concentrations of the reactants does not affect the equilibrium constant but does affect the equilibrium position.\nThermodynamics.\nChemical reactions are determined by the laws of thermodynamics. Reactions can proceed by themselves if they are exergonic, that is if they release free energy. The associated free energy change of the reaction is composed of the changes of two different thermodynamic quantities, enthalpy and entropy:\n; formula_1.\nReactions can be exothermic, where \u0394\"H\" is negative and energy is released. Typical examples of exothermic reactions are combustion, precipitation and crystallization, in which ordered solids are formed from disordered gaseous or liquid phases. In contrast, in endothermic reactions, heat is consumed from the environment. This can occur by increasing the entropy of the system, often through the formation of gaseous or dissolved reaction products, which have higher entropy. Since the entropy term in the free-energy change increases with temperature, many endothermic reactions preferably take place at high temperatures. On the contrary, many exothermic reactions such as crystallization occur preferably at lower temperatures. A change in temperature can sometimes reverse the sign of the enthalpy of a reaction, as for the carbon monoxide reduction of molybdenum dioxide:\n&lt;chem&gt;2CO(g) + MoO2(s) -&gt; 2CO2(g) + Mo(s)&lt;/chem&gt;; formula_2\nThis reaction to form carbon dioxide and molybdenum is endothermic at low temperatures, becoming less so with increasing temperature. \u0394\"H\"\u00b0 is zero at , and the reaction becomes exothermic above that temperature.\nChanges in temperature can also reverse the direction tendency of a reaction. For example, the water gas shift reaction\n&lt;chem&gt;CO(g) + H2O({v}) &lt;=&gt; CO2(g) + H2(g)&lt;/chem&gt;\nis favored by low temperatures, but its reverse is favored by high temperatures. The shift in reaction direction tendency occurs at .\nReactions can also be characterized by their internal energy change, which takes into account changes in the entropy, volume and chemical potentials. The latter depends, among other things, on the activities of the involved substances.\n; formula_3\nKinetics.\nThe speed at which reactions take place is studied by reaction kinetics. The rate depends on various parameters, such as:\nSeveral theories allow calculating the reaction rates at the molecular level. This field is referred to as reaction dynamics. The rate \"v\" of a first-order reaction, which could be the disintegration of a substance A, is given by:\nformula_4\nIts integration yields:\nformula_5\nHere \"k\" is the first-order rate constant, having dimension 1/time, [A](\"t\") is the concentration at a time \"t\" and [A]0 is the initial concentration. The rate of a first-order reaction depends only on the concentration and the properties of the involved substance, and the reaction itself can be described with a characteristic half-life. More than one time constant is needed when describing reactions of higher order. The temperature dependence of the rate constant usually follows the Arrhenius equation:\nformula_6\nwhere \"E\"a is the activation energy and \"k\"B is the Boltzmann constant. One of the simplest models of reaction rate is the collision theory. More realistic models are tailored to a specific problem and include the transition state theory, the calculation of the potential energy surface, the Marcus theory and the Rice\u2013Ramsperger\u2013Kassel\u2013Marcus (RRKM) theory.\nReaction types.\nFour basic types.\nSynthesis.\nIn a synthesis reaction, two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance. These reactions are in the general form:\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt;A + B-&gt;AB&lt;/chem&gt;\nTwo or more reactants yielding one product is another way to identify a synthesis reaction. One example of a synthesis reaction is the combination of iron and sulfur to form iron(II) sulfide:\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt;8Fe + S8-&gt;8FeS&lt;/chem&gt;\nAnother example is simple hydrogen gas combined with simple oxygen gas to produce a more complex substance, such as water.\nDecomposition.\nA decomposition reaction is when a more complex substance breaks down into its more simple parts. It is thus the opposite of a synthesis reaction and can be written as\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt;AB-&gt;A + B&lt;/chem&gt;\nOne example of a decomposition reaction is the electrolysis of water to make oxygen and hydrogen gas:\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt;2H2O-&gt;2H2 + O2&lt;/chem&gt;\nSingle displacement.\nIn a single displacement reaction, a single uncombined element replaces another in a compound; in other words, one element trades places with another element in a compound These reactions come in the general form of:\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt;A + BC-&gt;AC + B&lt;/chem&gt;\nOne example of a single displacement reaction is when magnesium replaces hydrogen in water to make magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas:\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt;Mg + 2H2O-&gt;Mg(OH)2 + H2 (^)&lt;/chem&gt;\nDouble displacement.\nIn a double displacement reaction, the anions and cations of two compounds switch places and form two entirely different compounds. These reactions are in the general form:\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt;AB + CD-&gt;AD + CB&lt;/chem&gt;\nFor example, when barium chloride (BaCl2) and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) react, the SO42\u2212 anion switches places with the 2Cl\u2212 anion, giving the compounds BaSO4 and MgCl2.\nAnother example of a double displacement reaction is the reaction of lead(II) nitrate with potassium iodide to form lead(II) iodide and potassium nitrate:\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt;Pb(NO3)2 + 2KI-&gt;PbI2(v) + 2KNO3&lt;/chem&gt;\nForward and backward reactions.\nAccording to Le Ch\u00e2telier's Principle, reactions may proceed in the forward or reverse direction until they end or reach equilibrium.\nForward reactions.\nReactions that proceed in the forward direction to approach equilibrium are often called spontaneous reactions, that is, formula_7 is negative, which means that if they occur at constant temperature and pressure, they decrease the Gibbs free energy of the reaction. They don't require much energy to proceed in the forward direction. Most reactions are forward reactions. Examples:\n2H2 + O2 \u21cc 2H2O\nCH3COOH + H2O \u21cc CH3COO- + H3O+\nBackward reactions.\nReactions that proceed in the forward direction to approach equilibrium are often called non-spontaneous reactions, that is, formula_7 is positive, which means that if they occur at constant temperature and pressure, they increase the Gibbs free energy of the reaction. They require input of energy to proceed in the forward direction. Examples include: \nCO2carbondioxide + H2Owater + photonslight energy \u2192 [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2oxygen\nCombustion.\nIn a combustion reaction, an element or compound reacts with an oxidant, usually oxygen, often producing energy in the form of heat or light. Combustion reactions frequently involve a hydrocarbon. For instance, the combustion of 1 mole (114 g) of octane in oxygen\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt;C8H18(l) + 25/2 O2(g)-&gt;8CO2 + 9H2O(l)&lt;/chem&gt;\nreleases 5500 kJ. A combustion reaction can also result from carbon, magnesium or sulfur reacting with oxygen.\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt;2Mg(s) + O2-&gt;2MgO(s)&lt;/chem&gt;\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt;S(s) + O2(g)-&gt;SO2(g)&lt;/chem&gt;\nOxidation and reduction.\nRedox reactions can be understood in terms of the transfer of electrons from one involved species (reducing agent) to another (oxidizing agent). In this process, the former species is \"oxidized\" and the latter is \"reduced\". Though sufficient for many purposes, these descriptions are not precisely correct. Oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation state of atoms and reduction as a decrease in oxidation state. In practice, the transfer of electrons will always change the oxidation state, but there are many reactions that are classed as \"redox\" even though no electron transfer occurs (such as those involving covalent bonds).\nIn the following redox reaction, hazardous sodium metal reacts with toxic chlorine gas to form the ionic compound sodium chloride, or common table salt:\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt;2Na(s) + Cl2(g)-&gt;2NaCl(s)&lt;/chem&gt;\nIn the reaction, sodium metal goes from an oxidation state of 0 (as it is a pure element) to +1: in other words, the sodium lost one electron and is said to have been oxidized. On the other hand, the chlorine gas goes from an oxidation of 0 (it is also a pure element) to \u22121: the chlorine gains one electron and is said to have been reduced. Because the chlorine is the one reduced, it is considered the electron acceptor, or in other words, induces oxidation in the sodium \u2013 thus the chlorine gas is considered the oxidizing agent. Conversely, the sodium is oxidized or is the electron donor, and thus induces a reduction in the other species and is considered the \"reducing agent\".\nWhich of the involved reactants would be a reducing or oxidizing agent can be predicted from the electronegativity of their elements. Elements with low electronegativities, such as most metals, easily donate electrons and oxidize \u2013 they are reducing agents. On the contrary, many oxides or ions with high oxidation numbers of their non-oxygen atoms, such as H2O2, MnO4-, CrO3, Cr2O72-, or OsO4, can gain one or two extra electrons and are strong oxidizing agents.\nFor some main-group elements the number of electrons donated or accepted in a redox reaction can be predicted from the electron configuration of the reactant element. Elements try to reach the low-energy noble gas configuration, and therefore alkali metals and halogens will donate and accept one electron, respectively. Noble gases themselves are chemically inactive.\nThe overall redox reaction can be balanced by combining the oxidation and reduction half-reactions multiplied by coefficients such that the number of electrons lost in the oxidation equals the number of electrons gained in the reduction.\nAn important class of redox reactions are the electrolytic electrochemical reactions, where electrons from the power supply at the negative electrode are used as the reducing agent and electron withdrawal at the positive electrode as the oxidizing agent. These reactions are particularly important for the production of chemical elements, such as chlorine or aluminium. The reverse process, in which electrons are released in redox reactions and chemical energy is converted to electrical energy, is possible and used in batteries.\nComplexation.\nIn complexation reactions, several ligands react with a metal atom to form a coordination complex. This is achieved by providing lone pairs of the ligand into empty orbitals of the metal atom and forming dipolar bonds. The ligands are Lewis bases, they can be both ions and neutral molecules, such as carbon monoxide, ammonia or water. The number of ligands that react with a central metal atom can be found using the 18-electron rule, saying that the valence shells of a transition metal will collectively accommodate 18 electrons, whereas the symmetry of the resulting complex can be predicted with the crystal field theory and ligand field theory. Complexation reactions also include ligand exchange, in which one or more ligands are replaced by another, and redox processes which change the oxidation state of the central metal atom.\nAcid\u2013base reactions.\nIn the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base theory, an acid\u2013base reaction involves a transfer of protons (H+) from one species (the acid) to another (the base). When a proton is removed from an acid, the resulting species is termed that acid's conjugate base. When the proton is accepted by a base, the resulting species is termed that base's conjugate acid. In other words, acids act as proton donors and bases act as proton acceptors according to the following equation:\n&lt;chem display=\"block\"&gt;\\underset{acid}{HA} + \\underset{base}{B} &lt;=&gt; \\underset{conjugated\\ base}{A^-} + \\underset{conjugated\\ acid}{HB+}&lt;/chem&gt;\nThe reverse reaction is possible, and thus the acid/base and conjugated base/acid are always in equilibrium. The equilibrium is determined by the acid and base dissociation constants (\"K\"a and \"K\"b) of the involved substances. A special case of the acid-base reaction is the neutralization where an acid and a base, taken at the exact same amounts, form a neutral salt.\nAcid-base reactions can have different definitions depending on the acid-base concept employed. Some of the most common are:\nPrecipitation.\nPrecipitation is the formation of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction. It usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the solubility limit and forms an insoluble salt. This process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by the removal of the solvent. Rapid precipitation results in an amorphous or microcrystalline residue and a slow process can yield single crystals. The latter can also be obtained by recrystallization from microcrystalline salts.\nSolid-state reactions.\nReactions can take place between two solids. However, because of the relatively small diffusion rates in solids, the corresponding chemical reactions are very slow in comparison to liquid and gas phase reactions. They are accelerated by increasing the reaction temperature and finely dividing the reactant to increase the contacting surface area.\nReactions at the solid/gas interface.\nThe reaction can take place at the solid|gas interface, surfaces at very low pressure such as ultra-high vacuum. Via scanning tunneling microscopy, it is possible to observe reactions at the solid|gas interface in real space, if the time scale of the reaction is in the correct range. Reactions at the solid|gas interface are in some cases related to catalysis.\nPhotochemical reactions.\nIn photochemical reactions, atoms and molecules absorb energy (photons) of the illumination light and convert it into an excited state. They can then release this energy by breaking chemical bonds, thereby producing radicals. Photochemical reactions include hydrogen\u2013oxygen reactions, radical polymerization, chain reactions and rearrangement reactions.\nMany important processes involve photochemistry. The premier example is photosynthesis, in which most plants use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, disposing of oxygen as a side-product. Humans rely on photochemistry for the formation of vitamin D, and vision is initiated by a photochemical reaction of rhodopsin. In fireflies, an enzyme in the abdomen catalyzes a reaction that results in bioluminescence. Many significant photochemical reactions, such as ozone formation, occur in the Earth atmosphere and constitute atmospheric chemistry.\nCatalysis.\nIn catalysis, the reaction does not proceed directly, but through a reaction with a third substance known as catalyst. Although the catalyst takes part in the reaction, forming weak bonds with reactants or intermediates, it is returned to its original state by the end of the reaction and so is not consumed. However, it can be inhibited, deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes. Catalysts can be used in a different phase (heterogeneous) or in the same phase (homogeneous) as the reactants. In heterogeneous catalysis, typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products. Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid-liquid system or evaporate in a solid\u2013gas system. Catalysts can only speed up the reaction \u2013 chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors. Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons. With a catalyst, a reaction that is kinetically inhibited by high activation energy can take place in the circumvention of this activation energy.\nHeterogeneous catalysts are usually solids, powdered in order to maximize their surface area. Of particular importance in heterogeneous catalysis are the platinum group metals and other transition metals, which are used in hydrogenations, catalytic reforming and in the synthesis of commodity chemicals such as nitric acid and ammonia. Acids are an example of a homogeneous catalyst, they increase the nucleophilicity of carbonyls, allowing a reaction that would not otherwise proceed with electrophiles. The advantage of homogeneous catalysts is the ease of mixing them with the reactants, but they may also be difficult to separate from the products. Therefore, heterogeneous catalysts are preferred in many industrial processes.\nReactions in organic chemistry.\nIn organic chemistry, in addition to oxidation, reduction or acid-base reactions, a number of other reactions can take place which involves covalent bonds between carbon atoms or carbon and heteroatoms (such as oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, etc.). Many specific reactions in organic chemistry are name reactions designated after their discoverers.\nSubstitution.\nIn a substitution reaction, a functional group in a particular chemical compound is replaced by another group. These reactions can be distinguished by the type of substituting species into a nucleophilic, electrophilic or radical substitution.\nIn the first type, a nucleophile, an atom or molecule with an excess of electrons and thus a negative charge or partial charge, replaces another atom or part of the \"substrate\" molecule. The electron pair from the nucleophile attacks the substrate forming a new bond, while the leaving group departs with an electron pair. The nucleophile may be electrically neutral or negatively charged, whereas the substrate is typically neutral or positively charged. Examples of nucleophiles are hydroxide ion, alkoxides, amines and halides. This type of reaction is found mainly in aliphatic hydrocarbons, and rarely in aromatic hydrocarbon. The latter have high electron density and enter nucleophilic aromatic substitution only with very strong electron withdrawing groups. Nucleophilic substitution can take place by two different mechanisms, SN1 and SN2. In their names, S stands for substitution, N for nucleophilic, and the number represents the kinetic order of the reaction, unimolecular or bimolecular.\nThe SN1 reaction proceeds in two steps. First, the leaving group is eliminated creating a carbocation. This is followed by a rapid reaction with the nucleophile.\nIn the SN2 mechanisms, the nucleophile forms a transition state with the attacked molecule, and only then the leaving group is cleaved. These two mechanisms differ in the stereochemistry of the products. SN1 leads to the non-stereospecific addition and does not result in a chiral center, but rather in a set of geometric isomers (\"cis/trans\"). In contrast, a reversal (Walden inversion) of the previously existing stereochemistry is observed in the SN2 mechanism.\nElectrophilic substitution is the counterpart of the nucleophilic substitution in that the attacking atom or molecule, an electrophile, has low electron density and thus a positive charge. Typical electrophiles are the carbon atom of carbonyl groups, carbocations or sulfur or nitronium cations. This reaction takes place almost exclusively in aromatic hydrocarbons, where it is called electrophilic aromatic substitution. The electrophile attack results in the so-called \u03c3-complex, a transition state in which the aromatic system is abolished. Then, the leaving group, usually a proton, is split off and the aromaticity is restored. An alternative to aromatic substitution is electrophilic aliphatic substitution. It is similar to the nucleophilic aliphatic substitution and also has two major types, SE1 and SE2\nIn the third type of substitution reaction, radical substitution, the attacking particle is a radical. This process usually takes the form of a chain reaction, for example in the reaction of alkanes with halogens. In the first step, light or heat disintegrates the halogen-containing molecules producing radicals. Then the reaction proceeds as an avalanche until two radicals meet and recombine.\n;&lt;chem&gt;X. + R-H -&gt; X-H + R.&lt;/chem&gt;\n;&lt;chem&gt;R. + X2 -&gt; R-X + X.&lt;/chem&gt;\nAddition and elimination.\nThe addition and its counterpart, the elimination, are reactions that change the number of substituents on the carbon atom, and form or cleave multiple bonds. Double and triple bonds can be produced by eliminating a suitable leaving group. Similar to the nucleophilic substitution, there are several possible reaction mechanisms that are named after the respective reaction order. In the E1 mechanism, the leaving group is ejected first, forming a carbocation. The next step, the formation of the double bond, takes place with the elimination of a proton (deprotonation). The leaving order is reversed in the E1cb mechanism, that is the proton is split off first. This mechanism requires the participation of a base. Because of the similar conditions, both reactions in the E1 or E1cb elimination always compete with the SN1 substitution.\nThe E2 mechanism also requires a base, but there the attack of the base and the elimination of the leaving group proceed simultaneously and produce no ionic intermediate. In contrast to the E1 eliminations, different stereochemical configurations are possible for the reaction product in the E2 mechanism, because the attack of the base preferentially occurs in the anti-position with respect to the leaving group. Because of the similar conditions and reagents, the E2 elimination is always in competition with the SN2-substitution.\nThe counterpart of elimination is an addition where double or triple bonds are converted into single bonds. Similar to substitution reactions, there are several types of additions distinguished by the type of the attacking particle. For example, in the electrophilic addition of hydrogen bromide, an electrophile (proton) attacks the double bond forming a carbocation, which then reacts with the nucleophile (bromine). The carbocation can be formed on either side of the double bond depending on the groups attached to its ends, and the preferred configuration can be predicted with the Markovnikov's rule. This rule states that \"In the heterolytic addition of a polar molecule to an alkene or alkyne, the more electronegative (nucleophilic) atom (or part) of the polar molecule becomes attached to the carbon atom bearing the smaller number of hydrogen atoms.\"\nIf the addition of a functional group takes place at the less substituted carbon atom of the double bond, then the electrophilic substitution with acids is not possible. In this case, one has to use the hydroboration\u2013oxidation reaction, wherein the first step, the boron atom acts as electrophile and adds to the less substituted carbon atom. In the second step, the nucleophilic hydroperoxide or halogen anion attacks the boron atom.\nWhile the addition to the electron-rich alkenes and alkynes is mainly electrophilic, the nucleophilic addition plays an important role in the carbon-heteroatom multiple bonds, and especially its most important representative, the carbonyl group. This process is often associated with elimination so that after the reaction the carbonyl group is present again. It is, therefore, called an addition-elimination reaction and may occur in carboxylic acid derivatives such as chlorides, esters or anhydrides. This reaction is often catalyzed by acids or bases, where the acids increase the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group by binding to the oxygen atom, whereas the bases enhance the nucleophilicity of the attacking nucleophile.\nNucleophilic addition of a carbanion or another nucleophile to the double bond of an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound can proceed via the Michael reaction, which belongs to the larger class of conjugate additions. This is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of C\u2013C bonds.\nSome additions which can not be executed with nucleophiles and electrophiles can be succeeded with free radicals. As with the free-radical substitution, the radical addition proceeds as a chain reaction, and such reactions are the basis of the free-radical polymerization.\nOther organic reaction mechanisms.\nIn a rearrangement reaction, the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule. These include hydride shift reactions such as the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, where a hydrogen, alkyl or aryl group migrates from one carbon to a neighboring carbon. Most rearrangements are associated with the breaking and formation of new carbon-carbon bonds. Other examples are sigmatropic reaction such as the Cope rearrangement.\nCyclic rearrangements include cycloadditions and, more generally, pericyclic reactions, wherein two or more double bond-containing molecules form a cyclic molecule. An important example of cycloaddition reaction is the Diels\u2013Alder reaction (the so-called [4+2] cycloaddition) between a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene to form a substituted cyclohexene system.\nWhether a certain cycloaddition would proceed depends on the electronic orbitals of the participating species, as only orbitals with the same sign of wave function will overlap and interact constructively to form new bonds. Cycloaddition is usually assisted by light or heat. These perturbations result in a different arrangement of electrons in the excited state of the involved molecules and therefore in different effects. For example, the [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions can be assisted by heat whereas the [2+2] cycloaddition is selectively induced by light. Because of the orbital character, the potential for developing stereoisomeric products upon cycloaddition is limited, as described by the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules.\nBiochemical reactions.\nBiochemical reactions are mainly controlled by enzymes. These proteins can specifically catalyze a single reaction so that reactions can be controlled very precisely. The reaction takes place in the active site, a small part of the enzyme which is usually found in a cleft or pocket lined by amino acid residues, and the rest of the enzyme is used mainly for stabilization. The catalytic action of enzymes relies on several mechanisms including the molecular shape (\"induced fit\"), bond strain, proximity and orientation of molecules relative to the enzyme, proton donation or withdrawal (acid/base catalysis), electrostatic interactions and many others.\nThe biochemical reactions that occur in living organisms are collectively known as metabolism. Among the most important of its mechanisms is the anabolism, in which different DNA and enzyme-controlled processes result in the production of large molecules such as proteins and carbohydrates from smaller units. Bioenergetics studies the sources of energy for such reactions. Important energy sources are glucose and oxygen, which can be produced by plants via photosynthesis or assimilated from food and air, respectively. All organisms use this energy to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which can then be used to energize other reactions.\nApplications.\nChemical reactions are central to chemical engineering, where they are used for the synthesis of new compounds from natural raw materials such as petroleum, mineral ores, and oxygen in air. It is essential to make the reaction as efficient as possible, maximizing the yield and minimizing the number of reagents, energy inputs and waste. Catalysts are especially helpful for reducing the energy required for the reaction and increasing its reaction rate.\nSome specific reactions have their niche applications. For example, the thermite reaction is used to generate light and heat in pyrotechnics and welding. Although it is less controllable than the more conventional oxy-fuel welding, arc welding and flash welding, it requires much less equipment and is still used to mend rails, especially in remote areas.\nMonitoring.\nMechanisms of monitoring chemical reactions depend strongly on the reaction rate. Relatively slow processes can be analyzed in situ for the concentrations and identities of the individual ingredients. Important tools of real-time analysis are the measurement of pH and analysis of optical absorption (color) and emission spectra. A less accessible but rather efficient method is the introduction of a radioactive isotope into the reaction and monitoring how it changes over time and where it moves to; this method is often used to analyze the redistribution of substances in the human body. Faster reactions are usually studied with ultrafast laser spectroscopy where utilization of femtosecond lasers allows short-lived transition states to be monitored at a time scaled down to a few femtoseconds.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As such, it forms a unique natural canal between the Orinoco and Amazon river systems. It is the world's largest river of the kind that links two major river systems, a so-called bifurcation. The area forms a water divide, more dramatically at regional flood stage.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Casiquiare\", first used in that form by Manuel Rom\u00e1n, likely derives from the Ye'kuana language name of the river, \"Kashishiwadi\".\nDiscovery.\nThe first to discover and describe it was Crist\u00f3bal Diatrist\u00e1n de Acu\u00f1a in 1639.\nIn 1744 a Jesuit priest named Manuel Rom\u00e1n, while ascending the Orinoco River in the region of La Esmeralda, met some Portuguese slave-traders from the settlements on the Rio Negro. The Portuguese insisted they were not in Spanish territory but on a tributary of the Amazon; they invited Rom\u00e1n back with them to prove their claim. He accompanied them on their return, by way of the Casiquiare canal, and afterwards retraced his route to the Orinoco. Along the way, he made first contact with the Ye'kuana people, whom he enlisted to help in his journey. Charles Marie de La Condamine, seven months later, was able to give to the \"Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\" an account of Father Rom\u00e1n's voyage, and thus confirm the existence of this waterway, first reported by Father Acu\u00f1a in 1639.\nLittle credence was given to Rom\u00e1n's statement until it was verified, in 1756, by the Spanish Boundary-line Commission of Jos\u00e9 Yturriaga and Solano. In 1800 German scientist Alexander von Humboldt and French botanist Aim\u00e9 Bonpland explored the river. During a 1924\u201325 expedition, Alexander H. Rice Jr. of Harvard University traveled up the Orinoco, traversed the Casiquiare canal, and descended the Rio Negro to the Amazon at Manaus. It was the first expedition to use aerial photography and shortwave radio for mapping of the region. In 1968 the Casiquiare was navigated by an SRN6 hovercraft during a National Geographic expedition.\nGeography.\nThe origin of the Casiquiare, at the River Orinoco, is below the mission of La Esmeralda at , and about above sea level. Its mouth at the Rio Negro, an affluent of the Amazon River, is near the town of San Carlos and is above sea level.\nThe general course is south-west, and its length, including windings, is about . Its width, at its bifurcation with the Orinoco, is approximately , with a current towards the Rio Negro of . However, as it gains in volume from the very numerous tributary streams, large and small, that it receives en route, its velocity increases, and in the wet season reaches , even in certain stretches. It broadens considerably as it approaches its mouth, where it is about wide. The volume of water the Casiquiare captures from the Orinoco is small in comparison to what it accumulates in its course. Nevertheless, the geological processes are ongoing, and evidence points to a slow and gradual increase in the size of Casiquiare. It is likely that stream capture is in progress, i.e. what currently is the uppermost Orinoco basin, including Cunucunuma River, eventually will be entirely diverted by the Casiquiare into the Amazon basin.\nIn flood time, it is said to have a second connection with the Rio Negro by a branch, which it throws off to the westward, called the Itinivini, which leaves it at a point about above its mouth. In the dry season, it has shallows, and is obstructed by sandbanks, a few rapids and granite rocks. Its shores are densely wooded, and the soil more fertile than that along the Rio Negro. The general slope of the plains through which the canal runs is south-west, but those of the Rio Negro slope south-east.\nThe Casiquiare is not a sluggish canal on a flat tableland, but a great, rapid river which, if its upper waters had not found contact with the Orinoco, perhaps by cutting back, would belong entirely to the Negro branch of the Amazon.\nTo the west of the Casiquiare, there is a much shorter and easier portage between the Orinoco and Amazon basins, called the isthmus of Pimichin, which is reached by ascending the Temi branch of the Atabapo River, an affluent of the Orinoco. Although the Temi is somewhat obstructed, it is believed that it could easily be made navigable for small craft. The isthmus is across, with undulating ground, nowhere over high, with swamps and marshes. In the early 20th century, it was much used for the transit of large canoes, which were hauled across it from the Temi River and reached the Rio Negro by a little stream called the Pimichin.\nHydrographic divide.\nThe Casiquiare canal \u2013 Orinoco River hydrographic divide is a representation of the hydrographic water divide that delineates the separation between the Orinoco Basin and the Amazon Basin. (The Orinoco Basin flows west\u2013north\u2013northeast into the Caribbean; the Amazon Basin flows east into the western Atlantic in the extreme northeast of Brazil.)\nEssentially the river divide is a west-flowing, upriver section of Venezuela's Orinoco River with an outflow to the south into the Amazon Basin. This named outflow is the Casiquiare canal, which, as it heads downstream (southerly), picks up speed and also accumulates water volume.\nThe greatest manifestation of the divide is during floods. During flood stage, the Casiquiare's main outflow point into the Rio Negro is supplemented by an overflow that is a second, and more minor, entry river bifurcation into the Rio Negro and upstream from its major, common low-water entry confluence with the Rio Negro. At flood, the river becomes an area flow source, far more than a narrow confined river.\nThe Casiquiare canal connects the upper Orinoco, below the mission of Esmeraldas, with the Rio Negro affluent of the Amazon River near the town of San Carlos.\nThe simplest description (besides the entire area-floodplain) of the water divide is a \"south-bank Orinoco River strip\" at the exit point of the Orinoco, also the origin of the Casiquiare canal. However, during the Orinoco's flood stage, that single, simply defined \"origin of the canal\" is turned into a region, and an entire strip along the southern bank of the Orinoco River.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is among the largest and oldest royal houses in Europe and the world, and consists of Hugh Capet, the founder of the dynasty, and his male-line descendants, who ruled in France without interruption from 987 to 1792, and again from 1814 to 1848. The senior line ruled in France as the House of Capet from the election of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of Charles IV in 1328. That line was succeeded by cadet branches, the Houses of Valois and then Bourbon, which ruled without interruption until the French Revolution abolished the monarchy in 1792. The Bourbons were restored in 1814 in the aftermath of Napoleon's defeat, but had to vacate the throne again in 1830 in favor of the last Capetian monarch of France, Louis Philippe I, who belonged to the House of Orl\u00e9ans.\nCadet branches of the Capetian House of Bourbon house are still reigning over Spain and Luxembourg.\nThe dynasty had a crucial role in the formation of the French state. Initially obeyed only in their own demesne, the \u00cele-de-France, the Capetian kings slowly but steadily increased their power and influence until it grew to cover the entirety of their realm. For a detailed narration on the growth of French royal power, see \"Crown lands of France\".\nMembers of the dynasty were traditionally Catholic, and the early Capetians had an alliance with the Church. The French were also the most active participants in the Crusades, culminating in a series of five Crusader kings \u2013 Louis VII, Philip Augustus, Louis VIII, Louis IX, and Philip III. The Capetian alliance with the papacy suffered a severe blow after the disaster of the Aragonese Crusade. Philip III's son and successor, Philip IV, humiliated Pope Boniface VIII and brought the papacy under French control. The later Valois, starting with Francis I, ignored religious differences and allied with the Ottoman sultan to counter the growing power of the Holy Roman Empire. Henry IV was a Protestant at the time of his accession, but realized the necessity of conversion after four years of religious warfare.\nThe Capetians generally enjoyed a harmonious family relationship. By tradition, younger sons and brothers of the king of France were given appanages for them to maintain their rank and to dissuade them from claiming the French crown itself. When Capetian cadets did aspire for kingship, their ambitions were directed not at the French throne, but at foreign thrones. As a result, the Capetians have reigned at different times in the kingdoms of Spain, Poland, Aragon, Portugal, Navarre, and as emperors of the Brazilian and Latin empires.\nIn modern times, King Felipe VI of Spain is a member of this family, while Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg is related to the family by agnatic kinship; both through the Bourbon branch of the dynasty. Along with the House of Habsburg, arguably its greatest historic rival, it was one of the two oldest European royal dynasties. It was also one of the most powerful royal families in European history, having played a pre-eminent role in its politics for much of its existence.\nName origins and usage.\nThe name of the dynasty derives from its founder, Hugh, who was known as \"Hugh Capet\". The meaning of \"Capet\" (a nickname rather than a surname of the modern sort) is unknown. While folk etymology identifies it with \"cape\", other suggestions indicate it might be connected to the Latin word \"caput\" (\"head\"), and explain it as meaning \"chief\" or \"head\".\nHistorians in the 19th century (see House of France) came to apply the name \"Capetian\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice. The name \"Capet\" has also been used as a surname for French royalty, particularly but not exclusively those of the House of Capet. One notable use was during the French Revolution, when the dethroned King Louis XVI (a member of the House of Bourbon and a direct male-line descendant of Hugh Capet) and Queen Marie Antoinette (a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine) were referred to as \"Louis and Antoinette Capet\" (the queen being addressed as \"the Widow Capet\" after the execution of her husband).\nCapetian miracle.\nThe Capetian Miracle () refers to the dynasty's ability to attain and hold onto the French crown.\nIn 987, Hugh Capet was elected to succeed Louis V of the Carolingian dynasty that had ruled France for over three centuries. By a process of associating elder sons with them in the kingship, the early Capetians established the hereditary succession in their family and transformed a theoretically electoral kingship into a sacral one. By the time of Philip II Augustus, who became king in 1180, the Capetian hold on power was so strong that the practice of associate kingship was dropped. While the Capetian monarchy began as one of the weakest in Europe, drastically eclipsed by the new Anglo-Norman realm in England (who, as dukes of Normandy, were technically their vassals) and even other great lords of France, the political value of orderly succession in the Middle Ages cannot be overstated. The orderly succession of power from father to son over such a long period of time meant that the French monarchs, who originally were essentially just the direct rulers of the \u00cele-de-France, were able to preserve and extend their power, while over the course of centuries the great peers of the realm would eventually lose their power in one succession crisis or another.\nBy comparison, the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem was constantly beset with internal succession disputes because each generation only produced female heirs who tended to die young. Even the English monarchy encountered severe succession crises, such as The Anarchy of the 1120s between Stephen and Matilda, and the murder of Arthur I, Duke of Brittany, the primogeniture heir of Richard I of England. The latter case would deal a severe blow to the prestige of King John, leading to the eventual destruction of Angevin hegemony in France. In contrast, the French kings were able to maintain uncontested father-to-son succession from the time of Hugh Capet until the succession crisis which began the Hundred Years' War of the 14th century.\nThe Robertians and before.\nThe dynastic surname now used to describe Hugh Capet's family prior to his election as King of France is \"Robertians\" or \"Robertines.\" The name is derived from the family's first certain ancestor, Robert the Strong (b. 820), the count of Paris. Robert was probably son of Robert III of Worms (b. 800) and grandson of Robert of Hesbaye (b. 770). The Robertians probably originated in the county Hesbaye, around Tongeren in modern-day Belgium. The sons of Robert the Strong were Odo and Robert, who both ruled as king of Western Francia. The family became Counts of Paris under Odo and Dukes of the Franks under Robert, possessing large parts of Neustria.\nIn the late 9th century, King Robert I, grandfather of Hugh Capet, married Beatrice of Vermandois, a direct descendent of Charlemagne, thus making the Capetian dynasty a cadet branch of the Carolingian dynasty.\nThe Carolingian dynasty ceased to rule France upon the death of Louis V. After the death of Louis V, the son of Hugh the Great, Hugh Capet, was elected by the nobility as king of France. Hugh was crowned at Noyon on 3 July 987 with the full support from Holy Roman Emperor Otto III. With Hugh's coronation, a new era began for France, and his descendants came to be named the \"Capetians,\" with the Capetian dynasty and its cadet branches such as the House of Valois ruling France for more than 800 years (987\u20131848, with some interruptions.\nCapetians through history.\nOver the succeeding centuries, Capetians spread throughout Europe, ruling every form of provincial unit from kingdoms to manors.\nSalic law.\nSalic law, reestablished during the Hundred Years' War from an ancient Frankish tradition, caused the French monarchy to permit only male (agnatic) descendants of Hugh to succeed to the throne of France.\nWithout Salic law, upon the death of John I, the crown would have passed to his half-sister, Joan (later Joan II of Navarre). However, Joan's paternity was suspect due to her mother's adultery in the Tour de Nesle Affair; the French magnates adopted Salic law to avoid the succession of a possible bastard.\nIn 1328, King Charles IV of France died without male heirs, as his brothers did before him. Philip of Valois, the late king's first cousin, acted as regent, pending the birth of the king's posthumous child, which proved to be a girl. Isabella of France, sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son, Edward III of England. The English king did not find support among the French lords, who made Philip of Valois their king. From then on the French succession not only excluded females but also rejected claims based on the female line of descent.\nThus the French crown passed from the House of Capet after the death of Charles IV to Philip VI of France of the House of Valois, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty,\nThis did not affect monarchies not under that law such as Portugal, Spain, Navarre, and various smaller duchies and counties. Therefore, many royal families appear and disappear in the French succession or become cadet branches upon marriage. A complete list of the senior-most line of Capetians is available below.\nCapetian cadet branches.\nThe Capetian Dynasty has been broken many times into (sometimes rival) cadet branches. A cadet branch is a line of descent from another line than the senior-most. This list of cadet branches shows most of the Capetian cadet lines and designating their royal French progenitor, although some sub-branches are not shown.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDescendants of Louis IX of France.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSenior Capets.\nThroughout most of history, the Senior Capet and the King of France were synonymous terms. Only in the time before Hugh Capet took the crown for himself and after the reign of Charles X is there a distinction such that the senior Capet must be identified independently from succession to the French Crown. However, since primogeniture and the Salic law provided for the succession of the French throne for most of French history, here is a list of all the French kings from Hugh until Charles, and all the Legitimist pretenders thereafter. All dates are for seniority, not reign.\nKing of France:\nLegitimist Pretenders:\nThe Capetian dynasty today.\nMany years have passed since the Capetian monarchs ruled a large part of Europe; however, they still remain as kings, as well as other titles. Currently two Capetian monarchs still rule in Spain and Luxembourg. In addition, seven pretenders represent exiled dynastic monarchies in Brazil, France, Spain, Portugal, Parma and Two Sicilies. The current legitimate, senior family member is Louis-Alphonse de Bourbon, known by his supporters as Duke of Anjou, who also holds the Legitimist (\"Blancs d'Espagne\") claim to the French throne. Overall, dozens of branches of the Capetian dynasty still exist throughout Europe.\nExcept for the House of Braganza (founded by an illegitimate son of King John I of Portugal, who was himself illegitimate), all current major Capetian branches are of the Bourbon cadet branch. Within the House of Bourbon, many of these lines are themselves well-defined cadet lines of the House.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A cuboctahedron has 12 identical vertices, with 2 triangles and 2 squares meeting at each, and 24 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a square. As such, it is a quasiregular polyhedron, i.e. an Archimedean solid that is not only vertex-transitive but also edge-transitive. It is radially equilateral.\nIts dual polyhedron is the rhombic dodecahedron.\nThe cuboctahedron was probably known to Plato: Heron's \"Definitiones\" quotes Archimedes as saying that Plato knew of a solid made of 8 triangles and 6 squares.\nOrthogonal projections.\nThe \"cuboctahedron\" has four special orthogonal projections, centered on a vertex, an edge, and the two types of faces, triangular and square. The last two correspond to the B2 and A2 Coxeter planes. The skew projections show a square and hexagon passing through the center of the cuboctahedron.\nSpherical tiling.\nThe cuboctahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.\nStructure.\nCoordinates.\nThe Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a cuboctahedron (of edge length \u221a2) centered at the origin are:\n(\u00b11,\u00b11,0)\n(\u00b11,0,\u00b11)\n(0,\u00b11,\u00b11)\nAn alternate set of coordinates can be made in 4-space, as 12 permutations of:\n(0,1,1,2)\nThis construction exists as one of 16 orthant facets of the cantellated 16-cell.\nRoot vectors.\nThe cuboctahedron's 12 vertices can represent the root vectors of the simple Lie group A3. With the addition of 6 vertices of the octahedron, these vertices represent the 18 root vectors of the simple Lie group B3.\nMetric properties.\nThe area \"A\" and the volume \"V\" of the cuboctahedron of edge length \"a\" are:\nformula_1\nDissection.\nTetrahedra and Octahedra.\nThe cuboctahedron can be dissected into 6 square pyramids and 8 tetrahedra meeting at a central point. This dissection is expressed in the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb where pairs of square pyramids are combined into octahedra.\nIrregular polyhedra.\nThe \"cuboctahedron\" can be dissected into two triangular cupolas by a common hexagon passing through the center of the cuboctahedron. If these two triangular cupolas are twisted so triangles and squares line up, Johnson solid J27, the triangular orthobicupola, is created.\nGeometric relations.\nRadial equilateral symmetry.\nIn a cuboctahedron, the long radius (center to vertex) is the same as the edge length; thus its long diameter (vertex to opposite vertex) is 2 edge lengths. Its center is like the apical vertex of a pyramid: one edge length away from \"all\" the other vertices. (In the case of the cuboctahedron, the center is in fact the apex of 6 square and 8 triangular pyramids). This radial equilateral symmetry is a property of only a few uniform polytopes, including the two-dimensional hexagon, the three-dimensional cuboctahedron, and the four-dimensional 24-cell and 8-cell (tesseract). \"Radially equilateral\" polytopes are those which can be constructed, with their long radii, from equilateral triangles which meet at the center of the polytope, each contributing two radii and an edge. Therefore, all the interior elements which meet at the center of these polytopes have equilateral triangle inward faces, as in the dissection of the cuboctahedron into 6 square pyramids and 8 tetrahedra. \nEach of these radially equilateral polytopes also occurs as cells of a characteristic space-filling tessellation: the tiling of regular hexagons, the rectified cubic honeycomb (of alternating cuboctahedra and octahedra), the 24-cell honeycomb and the tesseractic honeycomb, respectively. Each tessellation has a dual tessellation; the cell centers in a tessellation are cell vertices in its dual tessellation. The densest known regular sphere-packing in two, three and four dimensions uses the cell centers of one of these tessellations as sphere centers.\nA cuboctahedron has octahedral symmetry. Its first stellation is the compound of a cube and its dual octahedron, with the vertices of the cuboctahedron located at the midpoints of the edges of either.\nConstructions.\nA cuboctahedron can be obtained by taking an equatorial cross section of a four-dimensional 24-cell or 16-cell. A hexagon or a square can be obtained by taking an equatorial cross section of a cuboctahedron.\nThe cuboctahedron is a rectified cube and also a rectified octahedron.\nIt is also a cantellated tetrahedron. With this construction it is given the Wythoff symbol: 3 3 | 2. \nA skew cantellation of the tetrahedron produces a solid with faces parallel to those of the cuboctahedron, namely eight triangles of two sizes, and six rectangles. While its edges are unequal, this solid remains \"vertex-uniform\": the solid has the full tetrahedral symmetry group and its vertices are equivalent under that group.\nThe edges of a cuboctahedron form four regular hexagons. If the cuboctahedron is cut in the plane of one of these hexagons, each half is a triangular cupola, one of the Johnson solids; the cuboctahedron itself thus can also be called a triangular gyrobicupola, the simplest of a series (other than the gyrobifastigium or \"digonal gyrobicupola\"). If the halves are put back together with a twist, so that triangles meet triangles and squares meet squares, the result is another Johnson solid, the triangular orthobicupola, also called an anticuboctahedron.\nBoth triangular bicupolae are important in sphere packing. The distance from the solid's center to its vertices is equal to its edge length. Each central sphere can have up to twelve neighbors, and in a face-centered cubic lattice these take the positions of a cuboctahedron's vertices. In a hexagonal close-packed lattice they correspond to the corners of the triangular orthobicupola. In both cases the central sphere takes the position of the solid's center.\nCuboctahedra appear as cells in three of the convex uniform honeycombs and in nine of the convex uniform 4-polytopes.\nThe volume of the cuboctahedron is of that of the enclosing cube and of that of the enclosing octahedron.\nVertex arrangement.\nBecause it is radially equilateral, the cuboctahedron's center can be treated as a 13th \"canonical apical vertex\", one edge length distant from the 12 ordinary vertices, as the apex of a canonical pyramid is one edge length equidistant from its other vertices.\nThe cuboctahedron shares its edges and vertex arrangement with two nonconvex uniform polyhedra: the cubohemioctahedron (having the square faces in common) and the octahemioctahedron (having the triangular faces in common), both have four hexagons. It also serves as a cantellated tetrahedron, as being a rectified tetratetrahedron.\nThe cuboctahedron 2-covers the tetrahemihexahedron, which accordingly has the same abstract vertex figure (two triangles and two squares: 3.4.3.4) and half the vertices, edges, and faces. (The actual vertex figure of the tetrahemihexahedron is 3.4..4, with the factor due to the cross.)\nKinematics.\nWhen interpreted as a framework of rigid flat faces, connected along the edges by hinges, the cuboctahedron is a rigid structure, as are all convex polyhedra, by Cauchy's theorem. However, when the faces are removed, leaving only rigid edges connected by flexible joints at the vertices, the result is not a rigid system\n(unlike polyhedra whose faces are all triangles, to which Cauchy's theorem applies despite the missing faces).\nAdding a central vertex, connected by rigid edges to all the other vertices, subdivides the cuboctahedron into square pyramids and tetrahedra, meeting at the central vertex. Unlike the cuboctahedron itself, the resulting system of edges and joints is rigid, and forms part of the infinite octet truss structure.\nRelated polytopes.\nRegular polyhedra.\nThe cuboctahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.\nThe cuboctahedron also has tetrahedral symmetry with two colors of triangles.\nQuasiregular polyhedra and tilings.\nThe cuboctahedron exists in a sequence of symmetries of quasiregular polyhedra and tilings with vertex configurations (3.\"n\")2, progressing from tilings of the sphere to the Euclidean plane and into the hyperbolic plane. With orbifold notation symmetry of *\"n\"32 all of these tilings are wythoff construction within a fundamental domain of symmetry, with generator points at the right angle corner of the domain.\nThis polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of cantellated polyhedra with vertex figure (3.4.\"n\".4), and continues as tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These vertex-transitive figures have (*\"n\"32) reflectional symmetry.\n4-dimensional polytopes.\nThe cuboctahedron can be decomposed into a regular octahedron and eight irregular but equal octahedra in the shape of the convex hull of a cube with two opposite vertices removed. This decomposition of the cuboctahedron corresponds with the cell-first parallel projection of the 24-cell into three dimensions. Under this projection, the cuboctahedron forms the projection envelope, which can be decomposed into six square faces, a regular octahedron, and eight irregular octahedra. These elements correspond with the images of six of the octahedral cells in the 24-cell, the nearest and farthest cells from the 4D viewpoint, and the remaining eight pairs of cells, respectively.\nCuboctahedral graph.\nIn the mathematical field of graph theory, a cuboctahedral graph is the graph of vertices and edges of the cuboctahedron, one of the Archimedean solids. It can also be constructed as the line graph of the cube. It has 12 vertices and 24 edges, is locally linear, and is a quartic Archimedean graph.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Viewed from a corner it is a hexagon and its net is usually depicted as a cross.\nThe cube is the only regular hexahedron and is one of the five Platonic solids. It has 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices.\nThe cube is also a square parallelepiped, an equilateral cuboid and a right rhombohedron a 3-zonohedron. It is a regular square prism in three orientations, and a trigonal trapezohedron in four orientations.\nThe cube is dual to the octahedron. It has cubical or octahedral symmetry.\nThe cube is the only convex polyhedron whose faces are all squares.\nOrthogonal projections.\nThe \"cube\" has four special orthogonal projections, centered, on a vertex, edges, face and normal to its vertex figure. The first and third correspond to the A2 and B2 Coxeter planes.\nSpherical tiling.\nThe cube can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.\nCartesian coordinates.\nFor a cube centered at the origin, with edges parallel to the axes and with an edge length of 2, the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are\n(\u00b11, \u00b11, \u00b11)\nwhile the interior consists of all points (\"x\"0, \"x\"1, \"x\"2) with \u22121 &lt; \"x\"\"i\" &lt; 1 for all \"i\".\nEquation in three dimensional space.\nIn analytic geometry, a cube's surface with center (\"x\"0, \"y\"0, \"z\"0) and edge length of \"2a\" is the locus of all points (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") such that\nformula_1\nA cube can also be considered the limiting case of a 3D superellipsoid as all three exponents approach infinity.\nFormulas.\nFor a cube of edge length formula_2:\nAs the volume of a cube is the third power of its sides formula_3, third powers are called \"cubes\", by analogy with squares and second powers.\nA cube has the largest volume among cuboids (rectangular boxes) with a given surface area. Also, a cube has the largest volume among cuboids with the same total linear size (length+width+height).\nPoint in space.\nFor a cube whose circumscribing sphere has radius \"R\", and for a given point in its 3-dimensional space with distances \"di\" from the cube's eight vertices, we have:\nformula_4\nDoubling the cube.\nDoubling the cube, or the \"Delian problem\", was the problem posed by ancient Greek mathematicians of using only a compass and straightedge to start with the length of the edge of a given cube and to construct the length of the edge of a cube with twice the volume of the original cube. They were unable to solve this problem, which in 1837 Pierre Wantzel proved it to be impossible because the cube root of 2 is not a constructible number.\nUniform colorings and symmetry.\nThe cube has three uniform colorings, named by the unique colors of the square faces around each vertex: 111, 112, 123.\nThe cube has four classes of symmetry, which can be represented by vertex-transitive coloring the faces. The highest octahedral symmetry Oh has all the faces the same color. The dihedral symmetry D4h comes from the cube being a solid, with all the six sides being different colors. The prismatic subsets D2d has the same coloring as the previous one and D2h has alternating colors for its sides for a total of three colors, paired by opposite sides. Each symmetry form has a different Wythoff symbol.\nGeometric relations.\nA cube has eleven nets: that is, there are eleven ways to flatten a hollow cube by cutting seven edges. To color the cube so that no two adjacent faces have the same color, one would need at least three colors.\nThe cube is the cell of the only regular tiling of three-dimensional Euclidean space. It is also unique among the Platonic solids in having faces with an even number of sides and, consequently, it is the only member of that group that is a zonohedron (every face has point symmetry).\nThe cube can be cut into six identical square pyramids. If these square pyramids are then attached to the faces of a second cube, a rhombic dodecahedron is obtained (with pairs of coplanar triangles combined into rhombic faces).\nIn theology.\nCubes appear in Abrahamic religions. The Kaaba in Mecca is one example which is Arabic for \"the cube\". They also appear in Judaism as teffilin and New Jerusalem in the New Testament are described as being cubes.\nOther dimensions.\nThe analogue of a cube in four-dimensional Euclidean space has a special name\u2014a tesseract or hypercube. More properly, a hypercube (or \"n\"-dimensional cube or simply \"n\"-cube) is the analogue of the cube in \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space and a tesseract is the order-4 hypercube. A hypercube is also called a \"measure polytope\".\nThere are analogues of the cube in lower dimensions too: a point in dimension 0, a line segment in one dimension and a square in two dimensions.\nRelated polyhedra.\nThe quotient of the cube by the antipodal map yields a projective polyhedron, the hemicube.\nIf the original cube has edge length 1, its dual polyhedron (an octahedron) has edge length formula_5.\nThe cube is a special case in various classes of general polyhedra:\nThe vertices of a cube can be grouped into two groups of four, each forming a regular tetrahedron; more generally this is referred to as a demicube. These two together form a regular compound, the stella octangula. The intersection of the two forms a regular octahedron. The symmetries of a regular tetrahedron correspond to those of a cube which map each tetrahedron to itself; the other symmetries of the cube map the two to each other.\nOne such regular tetrahedron has a volume of of that of the cube. The remaining space consists of four equal irregular tetrahedra with a volume of of that of the cube, each.\nThe rectified cube is the cuboctahedron. If smaller corners are cut off we get a polyhedron with six octagonal faces and eight triangular ones. In particular we can get regular octagons (truncated cube). The rhombicuboctahedron is obtained by cutting off both corners and edges to the correct amount.\nA cube can be inscribed in a dodecahedron so that each vertex of the cube is a vertex of the dodecahedron and each edge is a diagonal of one of the dodecahedron's faces; taking all such cubes gives rise to the regular compound of five cubes.\nIf two opposite corners of a cube are truncated at the depth of the three vertices directly connected to them, an irregular octahedron is obtained. Eight of these irregular octahedra can be attached to the triangular faces of a regular octahedron to obtain the cuboctahedron.\nThe cube is topologically related to a series of spherical polyhedral and tilings with order-3 vertex figures.\nThe cuboctahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.\nThe cube is topologically related as a part of sequence of regular tilings, extending into the hyperbolic plane: {4,p}, p=3,4,5...\nWith dihedral symmetry, Dih4, the cube is topologically related in a series of uniform polyhedral and tilings 4.2n.2n, extending into the hyperbolic plane:\nAll these figures have octahedral symmetry.\nThe cube is a part of a sequence of rhombic polyhedra and tilings with [\"n\",3] Coxeter group symmetry.

{"id": "6286", "revid": "1160435640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6286", "title": "Commuter rail", "text": "Passenger rail transport services primarily within metropolitan areas\nCommuter rail, or suburban rail, is a passenger rail transport service that primarily operates within a metropolitan area, connecting commuters to a central city from adjacent suburbs or commuter towns. Commuter rail systems are considered heavy rail, using electrified or diesel trains. Distance charges or zone pricing may be used.\nThe term can refer to systems with a wide variety of different features and service frequencies, but is often used in contrast to rapid transit or light rail.\nSome services share similarities with both commuter rail and high-frequency rapid transit, examples being the German S-Bahn in some cities, the R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional (RER) in Paris, the S Lines in Milan, many Japanese commuter systems, the East Rail line in Hong Kong and some Australasian suburban networks, such as Sydney Trains. Some services, like British commuter rail, share tracks with other passenger services and freight.\nIn North America, commuter rail sometimes refers only to systems that primarily operate during peak periods and offer little to no service for the rest of the day, with regional rail being used to refer to systems that offer all-day service.\nCharacteristics.\nMost commuter (or suburban) trains are built to main line rail standards, differing from light rail or rapid transit (metro rail) systems by:\nTrain schedule.\nCompared to rapid transit (or metro rail), commuter/suburban rail often has lower frequency, following a schedule rather than fixed intervals, and fewer stations spaced further apart. They primarily serve lower density suburban areas (non inner-city), generally only having one or two stops in a city's central business district, and often share right-of-way with intercity or freight trains. Some services operate only during peak hours and others uses fewer departures during off peak hours and weekends. Average speeds are high, often 50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph) or higher. These higher speeds better serve the longer distances involved. Some services include express services which skip some stations in order to run faster and separate longer distance riders from short-distance ones.\nThe general range of commuter trains' travel distance varies between 15 and 200\u00a0km (10 and 125 miles), but longer distances can be covered when the trains run between two or several cities (e.g. S-Bahn in the Ruhr area of Germany). Distances between stations may vary, but are usually much longer than those of urban rail systems. In city centers the train either has a terminal station or passes through the city centre with notably fewer station stops than those of urban rail systems. Toilets are often available on-board trains and in stations.\nTrack.\nTheir ability to coexist with freight or intercity services in the same right-of-way can drastically reduce system construction costs. However, frequently they are built with dedicated tracks within that right-of-way to prevent delays, especially where service densities have converged in the inner parts of the network.\nMost such trains run on the local standard gauge track. Some systems may run on a narrower or broader gauge. Examples of narrow gauge systems are found in Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, Switzerland, in the Brisbane (Queensland Rail's City network) and Perth (Transperth) systems in Australia, in some systems in Sweden, and on the in Italy. Some countries and regions, including Finland, India, Pakistan, Russia, Brazil and Sri Lanka, as well as San Francisco (BART) in the US and Melbourne and Adelaide in Australia, use broad gauge track.\nDistinction between other modes of rail.\nMetro.\nMetro rail and rapid transit usually cover smaller inner-urban areas within of city centers, run more frequently, and use dedicated tracks (underground or elevated), whereas commuter rail often shares tracks, technology and the legal framework within mainline railway systems.\nHowever, the classification as a metro or rapid rail can be difficult as both may typically cover a metropolitan area exclusively, run on separate tracks in the centre, and often feature purpose-built rolling stock. The fact that the terminology is not standardised across countries (even across English-speaking countries) further complicates matters. This distinction is most easily made when there are two (or more) systems such as New York's subway and the LIRR and Metro-North Railroad, Paris' M\u00e9tro and RER along with Transilien, Washington D.C.'s Metro along with its MARC and VRE, London's tube lines of the Underground and the Overground, Elizabeth line, Thameslink along with other commuter rail operators, Madrid's Metro and Cercan\u00edas, Barcelona's Metro and Rodalies, and Tokyo's subway and the JR lines along with various privately owned and operated commuter rail systems.\nRegional rail.\nRegional rail usually provides rail services between towns and cities, rather than purely linking major population hubs in the way inter-city rail does. Regional rail operates outside major cities. Unlike Inter-city, it stops at most or all stations between cities. It provides a service between smaller communities along the line that are often byproducts of ribbon developments, and also connects with long-distance services at interchange stations located at junctions, terminals, or larger towns along the line. Alternative names are \"local train\" or \"stopping train\". Examples include the former BR's Regional Railways, France's TER (\"Transport express r\u00e9gional\"), Germany's Regionalexpress and Regionalbahn, and South Korea's Tonggeun services.\nInter-city rail.\nIn some European countries, the distinction between commuter trains and long-distance/intercity trains is subtle, due to the relatively short distances involved. For example, so-called \"intercity\" trains in Belgium and the Netherlands carry many commuters, while their equipment, range, and speeds are similar to those of commuter trains in some larger countries. In the United Kingdom, there is no division of organisation or branding between commuter, regional, and inter-city trains, providing no obvious means for their categorization.\nRussian commuter trains, on the other hand, frequently cover areas larger than Belgium itself, although these are still short distances by Russian standards. They have a different ticketing system from long-distance trains, and in major cities they often operate from a separate section of the train station.\nSome consider \"inter-city\" service to be that which operates as an express service between two main city stations, bypassing intermediate stations. However, this term is used in Australia (Sydney for example) to describe the regional trains operating beyond the boundaries of the suburban services, even though some of these \"inter-city\" services stop all stations similar to German regional services. In this regard, the German service delineations and naming conventions are clearer and better used for academic purposes.\nHigh-speed rail.\nSometimes high-speed rail can serve daily use of commuters. The Japanese Shinkansen high speed rail system is heavily used by commuters in the Greater Tokyo Area, who commute between by Shinkansen. To meet the demand of commuters, JR sells commuter discount passes. Before 2021, they operated 16-car bilevel E4 Series Shinkansen trains at rush hour, providing a capacity of 1,600 seats. Several lines in China, such as the Beijing\u2013Tianjin Intercity Railway and the Shanghai\u2013Nanjing High-Speed Railway, serve a similar role with many more under construction or planned.\nIn South Korea, some sections of the high-speed rail network are also heavily used by commuters, such as the section between Gwangmyeong Station and Seoul Station on the KTX network (Gyeongbu HSR Line), or the section between Dongtan Station and Suseo station on the SRT Line. \nThe high-speed services linking Z\u00fcrich, Bern and Basel in Switzerland () have brought the Central Business Districts (CBDs) of these three cities within 1 hour of each other. This has resulted in unexpectedly high demand for new commuter trips between the three cities and a corresponding increase in suburban rail passengers accessing the high-speed services at the main city-centre stations (\"Hauptbahnhof\"). The Regional-Express commuter service between Munich and Nuremberg in Germany runs at on the Nuremberg\u2013Munich high-speed railway.\nThe regional trains Stockholm\u2013Uppsala, Stockholm\u2013V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Stockholm\u2013Eskilstuna and Gothenburg\u2013Trollh\u00e4ttan in Sweden reach and have many daily commuters.\nIn Great Britain, the HS1 domestic services between London and Ashford runs at a top speed of 225 km/h, and in peak hours the trains can be full with commuters standing. \nThe Athens Suburban Railway in Greece consists of five lines, 4 of which are electrified. The Kiato\u2013Piraeus line and the Aigio\u2013Airport lines reach speeds of up to . The Athens\u2013Chalcis line is also expected to attain speeds of up to upon upgrading of the SKA\u2013Oinoi railway sector. These lines also have many daily commuters, with the number expected to rise even higher upon full completion of the Acharnes Railway Center.\nEski\u015fehir-Ankara and Konya-Ankara high speed train routes serve as high speed commuter trains in Turkey.\nTrain types.\nCommuter/suburban trains are usually optimized for maximum passenger volume, in most cases without sacrificing too much comfort and luggage space, though they seldom have all the amenities of long-distance trains. Cars may be single- or double-level, and aim to provide seating for all. Compared to intercity trains, they have less space, fewer amenities and limited baggage areas.\nMultiple unit type.\nCommuter rail trains are usually composed of multiple units, which are self-propelled, bidirectional, articulated passenger rail cars with driving motors on each (or every other) bogie. Depending on local circumstances and tradition they may be powered either by diesel engines located below the passenger compartment (diesel multiple units) or by electricity picked up from third rails or overhead lines (electric multiple units). Multiple units are almost invariably equipped with control cabs at both ends, which is why such units are so frequently used to provide commuter services, due to the associated short turn-around time.\nLocomotive hauled services.\nLocomotive hauled services are used in some countries or locations. This is often a case of asset sweating, by using a single large combined fleet for intercity and regional services. Loco hauled services are usually run in push-pull formation, that is, the train can run with the locomotive at the \"front\" or \"rear\" of the train (pushing or pulling). Trains are often equipped with a control cab at the other end of the train from the locomotive, allowing the train operator to operate the train from either end. The motive power for locomotive-hauled commuter trains may be either electric or diesel-electric, although some countries, such as Germany and some of the former Soviet-bloc countries, also use diesel-hydraulic locomotives.\nSeat plans.\nIn the US and some other countries, a three-and-two seat plan is used. However, few people sit in the middle seat on these trains because they feel crowded and uncomfortable.\nIn Japan, South Korea and Indonesia, longitudinal (sideways window-lining) seating is widely used in many commuter rail trains to increase capacity in rush hours. Carriages are usually not organized to increase seating capacity (although in some trains at least one carriage would feature more doors to facilitate easier boarding and alighting and bench seats so that they can be folded up during rush hour to provide more standing room) even in the case of commuting longer than 50\u00a0km and commuters in the Greater Tokyo Area, Seoul metropolitan area, and Jabodetabek area have to stand in the train for more than an hour.\nCommuter rail systems around the world.\nAfrica.\nCurrently there are not many examples of commuter rail in Africa. Metrorail operates in the major cities of South Africa, and there are some commuter rail services in Algeria, Botswana, Kenya, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia.\nIn Algeria, SNTF operates commuter rail lines between the capital Algiers and its southern and eastern suburbs. They also serve to connect Algiers' main universities to each other. The Dar es Salaam commuter rail offers intracity services in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In Botswana, the (Botswana Railways) \"BR Express\" has a commuter train between Lobatse and Gaborone.\nAsia.\nEast Asia.\nIn Japan, commuter rail systems have extensive network and frequent service and are heavily used. In many cases, Japanese commuter rail is operationally more like a typical metro system (frequent trains, an emphasis on standing passengers, short station spacings) than it is like commuter rail in other countries. Japanese commuter rail commonly interline with city center subway lines, with commuter rail trains continuing into the subway network, and then out onto different commuter rail systems on the other side of the city. Many Japanese commuter systems operate various stopping patterns to reduce the travel time to distant locations, often using station passing loops instead of dedicated express tracks. It is notable that the larger Japanese commuter rail systems are owned and operated by for-profit private railway companies, without public subsidy.\nEast Japan Railway Company operates a large suburban train network in Tokyo with various lines connecting the suburban areas to the city center. While the Yamanote Line, Keihin Tohoku Line, Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line services arguably are more akin to rapid transit with frequent stops, simple stopping patterns (relative to other JR East lines) no branching services and largely serving the inner suburbs; other services along the Ch\u016b\u014d Rapid Line, S\u014dbu Rapid Line/Yokosuka Line, Ueno\u2013Tokyo Line, Sh\u014dnan\u2013Shinjuku Line etc. are mid-distance services from suburban lines in the outer reaches of Greater Tokyo through operating into these lines to form a high frequency corridor though central Tokyo.\nOther commuter rail routes in Japan include:\nCommuter rail systems have been inaugurated in several cities in China such as Beijing, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Changsha and the Pearl River Delta. With plans for large systems in northeastern Zhejiang, Jingjinji, and Yangtze River Delta areas. The level of service varies considerably from line to line ranging high to near high speeds. More developed and established lines such as the Guangshen Railway have more frequent metro-like service. \nThe two MTR lines which are owned and formerly operated by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (East Rail line and Tuen Ma line which is integrated from the former West Rail line and Ma On Shan line in 2021), then the \"KCR\"), and MTR's own Tung Chung line connect the new towns in New Territories and the city centre Kowloon together with frequent intervals, and some New Territories-bound trains terminate at intermediate stations, providing more frequent services in Kowloon and the towns closer to Kowloon. Most of the sections of these four lines are overground and some sections of the East Rail Line share tracks with intercity trains to mainland China. The three KCR lines are integrated into the MTR network since 2008 and most passengers do not need to exit and re-enter the system through separate fare gates and purchase separate tickets to transfer between such lines and the rest of the network (the exceptions are between the Tuen Ma line's East Tsim Sha Tsui station and the Tsuen Wan line's Tsim Sha Tsui station.\nIn Taiwan, the Western line in the Taipei-Taoyuan Metropolitan Area, Taichung Metropolitan Area and Tainan-Kaohsiung Metropolitan Area as well as the Neiwan-Liujia line in the Hsinchu Area are considered commuter rail.\nIn South Korea, the Seoul Metropolitan Subway includes a total of 22 lines, and some of its lines are suburban lines. This is especially the case for lines operated by Korail, such as the Gyeongui-Jungang Line, the Gyeongchun Line, the Suin-Bundang Line, or the Gyeonggang Line. Even some lines not operated by Korail, such as the AREX Line, the Seohae Line or the Shinbundang Line mostly function as commuter rail. Lastly, even for the \"numbered lines\" (1-9) of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway which mostly travel in the dense parts of Seoul, some track sections extend far outside of the city, and operate large sections at ground level, such as on the Line 1, Line 3 and Line 4. In Busan, the Donghae Line, while part of the Busan Metro system, mostly functions as a commuter rail line.\nSoutheast Asia.\nIn Indonesia, the KRL Commuterline is the largest commuter rail system in the country, serving the Greater Jakarta. It connects the Jakarta city center with surrounding cities and sub-urbans in Banten and West Java provinces, including Depok, Bogor, Tangerang, Serpong, Rangkasbitung, Bekasi and Cikarang. In July 2015, KA Commuter Jabodetabek served more than 850,000 passengers per day, which is almost triple of the 2011 figures, but still less than 3.5% of all Jabodetabek commutes. Other commuter rail systems in Indonesia include the Metro Surabaya Commuter Line, Prambanan Express, KRL Commuterline Yogyakarta\u2013Solo, Kedung Sepur, and the Greater Bandung Commuter.\nIn the Philippines, the Philippine National Railways has two commuter rail systems currently operational; the PNR Metro Commuter Line in the Greater Manila Area and the PNR Bicol Commuter in the Bicol Region. A new commuter rail line in Metro Manila, the North\u2013South Commuter Railway, is currently under construction. Its North section is set to be partially opened by 2021.\nIn Malaysia, there are two commuter services operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu. They are the KTM Komuter that serves Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding Klang Valley area, and the KTM Komuter Northern Sector that serves Greater Penang, Perak, Kedah and Perlis in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia.\nIn Thailand, the Greater Bangkok Commuter rail and the Airport Rail Link serve the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. The SRT Red Lines, a new commuter line in Bangkok, started construction in 2009. It opened in 2021.\nAnother commuter rail system in Southeast Asia is the Yangon Circular Railway in Myanmar.\nSouth Asia.\nIn India, commuter rail systems are present in major cities. Mumbai Suburban Railway, the oldest suburban rail system in Asia, carries more than 7.24 million commuters on a daily basis which constitutes more than half of the total daily passenger capacity of the Indian Railways itself. Kolkata Suburban Railway is the biggest Suburban Railway network in India covering 348 stations carries more than 3.5 million commuters per day. The Chennai Suburban Railway along with Chennai MRTS is another railway of comparison where more than 2.5 million people travel daily to different areas in Chennai. Other commuter railways in India include Hyderabad MMTS, Delhi Suburban Railway, Pune Suburban Railway and Lucknow-Kanpur Suburban Railway.\nIn 2020, Government of India approved Bengaluru Suburban Railway to connect Bengaluru and its suburbs. It will be unique and first of its kind in India as it will have metro like facilities and rolling stock.\nKarachi in Pakistan has had a circular railway since 1969.\nWest Asia.\nIn Iran, SYSTRA proposed 4 express lines similar to RER suburban lines in Paris. Tehran Metro is going to construct express lines. For instance, the Rahyab Behineh, a consultant for Tehran Metro, is studying Tehran Express Line 2. Tehran Metro currently has a commuter line, which is Line 5 between Tehran and Karaj. Isfahan has two lines to its suburbs Baharestan and Fuladshahr under construction, and a third line to Shahinshahr is planned.\nIn Turkey; Ba\u015fkentray, \u0130ZBAN, Marmaray and Gaziray are well-known examples.\nEurope.\nMajor metropolitan areas in most European countries are usually served by extensive commuter/suburban rail systems. Well-known examples include BG Voz in Belgrade (Serbia), S-Bahn in Germany, Austria and German-speaking areas of Switzerland, Proastiakos in Greece, RER in France and Belgium, Servizio ferroviario suburbano in Italy, Cercan\u00edas and Rodalies (Catalonia) in Spain, CP Urban Services in Portugal, Esko in Prague and Ostrava (Czech Republic), H\u00c9V in Budapest (Hungary) and DART in Dublin (Ireland).\nLondon has multiple commuter rail routes:\nThe Merseyrail network in Liverpool consists of two commuter rail routes powered by third rail, both of which branch out at one end. At the other, the Northern Line continues out of the city centre to a mainline rail interchange, while the Wirral Line has a city-centre loop.\nBirmingham has four suburban routes, one of which is operated with diesel trains.\nThe Tyneside Electrics system in Newcastle existed from 1904 to 1967 using DC third rail. British Rail did not have the budget to maintain the ageing electrification system. The Riverside Branch was closed, while the remaining lines were de-electrified. 13 years later, they were re-electrified using DC overhead wires, and now form the Tyne &amp; Wear Metro Yellow Line.\nMany of the rail services around Glasgow are branded as Strathclyde Partnership for Transport. The network includes most electrified Scottish rail routes.\nThe Metro run eleven services which feed into Leeds, connecting the city with commuter areas and neighbouring urban centres in the West Yorkshire Connurbation.\nMetroWest is a proposed network in Bristol, northern Somerset &amp; southern Gloucestershire. The four-tracking of the line between Bristol Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway stations will enable local rail services to be separated from long-distance trains.\nThe R\u00e9seau express r\u00e9gional d'\u00cele-de-France (RER) is a commuter rail network in the agglomeration of Paris. In the centre the RER has high frequency underground corridors where several suburban branches feed similar to a rapid transit system.\nCommuter rail systems in Germany are called S-Bahn. While in some major cities S-Bahn services run on separate lines exclusively other systems use the existing regional rail tracks.\nRandstadspoor is a network of Sprinter train services in and around the city of Utrecht in the Netherlands. For the realisation of this network, new stations were opened. Separate tracks have been built for these trains, so they can call frequently without disturbing high-frequent Intercity services parallel to these routes. Similar systems are planned for The Hague and Rotterdam.\nIn Sweden, electrified commuter rail systems known as \"Pendelt\u00e5g\" are present in the cities of Stockholm and Gothenburg. The Stockholm commuter rail system, which began in 1968, shares railway tracks with inter-city trains and freight trains, but for the most part runs on its own dedicated tracks. It is primarily used to transport passengers from nearby towns and other suburban areas into the city centre, not for transportation inside the city centre. The Gothenburg commuter rail system, which began in 1960, is similar to the Stockholm system, but does fully share tracks with long-distance trains.\nIn Norway, the Oslo commuter rail system mostly shares tracks with more long-distance trains, but also runs on some local railways without other traffic. Services converge on a primary main line between Asker and Lillestr\u00f8m. Oslo has the largest commuter rail system in the Nordic countries in terms of line lengths and number of stations. But some lines have travel times (over an hour from Oslo) and frequencies (once per hour) which are more like regional trains. Also Bergen, Stavanger and Trondheim have commuter rail systems. These have only one or two lines each and they share tracks with other trains.\nIn Finland, the Helsinki commuter rail network runs on dedicated tracks from Helsinki Central railway station to Lepp\u00e4vaara and Kerava. The Ring Rail Line serves Helsinki Airport and northern suburbs of Vantaa and is exclusively used by the commuter rail network. On 15 December 2019 Tampere got its own commuter rail service.\nIn Spain \"Cercan\u00edas\" networks exist in Madrid, Sevilla, Murcia/Alicante, San Sebasti\u00e1n, C\u00e1diz, Valencia, Asturias, Santander, Zaragoza, Bilbao and M\u00e1laga. All these systems include underground sections in the city centre. There is also a network of narrow-gauge commuter systems in North Spain and Murcia.\nIn the autonomous community of Catalonia, and unlike the rest of Spain, the commuter service is not managed by Renfe Operadora. Since 2010, the Government of Catalonia has managed all the regular commuter services with the \"transfer of \"Rodalies\"\". There are two companies that manage the Catalan commuter network:\nThe Government of Catalonia will assume full control of the current R12 regional line in 2024 and it will be owned by the FGC. It will eliminate the current line and replace it with the new commuter lines RL3 and RL4, towards Cervera and Manresa from Lleida respectively.\nIn Italy there are several commuter rail networks:\nIn Poland, commuter rail systems exist in Tricity, Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w (SKA) and Katowice (SKR). There is also a similar system planned in Wroc\u0142aw and Szczecin. The terms used are \"Szybka Kolej Miejska\" (fast urban rail) and \"kolej aglomeracyjna\" (agglomeration rail). These systems are:\nThe Proastiakos (; \"suburban\") is Greece's suburban railway (commuter rail) services, which are run by TrainOSE, on infrastructure owned by the Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE). There are three Proastiakos networks, servicing the country's three largest cities: Athens, Thessaloniki and Patras. In particular, the Athenian network is undergoing modifications to completely separate it from mainline traffic, by re-routing the tracks via a tunnel underneath the city center. A similar project is planned for the Patras network, whereas a new line is due to be constructed for the Thessalonian network.\nIn Romania, the first commuter trains were introduced in December 2019. They operate between Bucharest and Funduea or Buftea.\nBG Voz is an urban rail system that serves Belgrade. It currently has only two routes, with plans for further expansion. Between early 1990s and mid-2010s, there was another system, known as Beovoz, that was used to provide mass-transit service within the Belgrade metropolitan area, as well as to nearby towns, similarly to RER in Paris. Beovoz had more lines and far more stops than the current system. However, it was abandoned in favor of more accurate BG Voz, mostly due to inefficiency. While current services rely mostly on the existing infrastructure, any further development means furthering capacities (railways expansion and new trains). Plans for further extension of system include another two lines, one of which should reach Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport.\nIn Russia, Ukraine and some other countries of the former Soviet Union, electrical multiple unit passenger suburban trains called Elektrichka are widespread. The first such system in Russia is the Oranienbaum Electric Line in St. Petersburg. In Moscow the Beskudnikovskaya railway branch existed between the 1940s and 1980s. The trains that shuttled along it did not go to the main lines, so it was a city transport. Today there are the Moscow Central Circle and the Moscow Central Diameters.\nIn Turkey, Marmaray line stations from Sirkeci to Halkal\u0131 are located at the European side. Overground section between Kazl\u0131\u00e7e\u015fme and Sirkeci, stations such as Cankurtaran, are closed since 2013.\nAmericas.\nNorth America.\nIn the United States, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Mexico regional passenger rail services are provided by governmental or quasi-governmental agencies, with the busiest and most expansive rail networks located in the Northeastern US, California, and Eastern Canada. Most North American commuter railways utilize diesel locomotive propulsion, with the exception of services in New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, and Mexico City; New York's commuter rail lines use a combination of third rail and overhead wire power generation, while Chicago only has two out of twelve services that are electrified. Many newer and proposed systems in Canada and the United States are often are geared to serving peak-hour commutes as opposed to the all-day systems of Europe, East Asia, and Australia.\nUnited States.\nEight commuter rail systems in the United States carried over ten million trips in 2018, those being in descending order:\nOther commuter rail systems in the United States (not in ridership order) are:\nSouth America.\nExamples include an commuter system in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, the long Supervia in Rio de Janeiro, the Metrotr\u00e9n in Santiago, Chile, and the Valpara\u00edso Metro in Valpara\u00edso, Chile.\nAnother example is Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM) in Greater S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. CPTM has 94 stations with seven lines, numbered starting on 7 (the lines 1 to 6 and the line 15 belong to the S\u00e3o Paulo Metro), with a total length of . Trains operates at high frequencies on tracks used exclusively for commuter traffic. In Rio de Janeiro SuperVia provides electrified commuter rail services.\nOceania.\nThe five major cities in Australia have suburban railway systems in their metropolitan areas. These networks have frequent services, with frequencies varying from every 10 to every 30 minutes on most suburban lines, and up to 3\u20135 minutes in peak on bundled underground lines in the city centres of Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne. The networks in each state developed from mainline railways and have never been completely operationally separate from long distance and freight traffic, unlike metro systems. The suburban networks are almost completely electrified.\nThe main suburban rail networks in Australia are:\nNew Zealand has two frequent suburban rail services comparable to those in Australia: the Auckland rail network is operated by Auckland One Rail and the Wellington rail network is operated by Transdev Wellington.\nHybrid urban-suburban rail systems.\nHybrid urban-suburban rail systems exhibiting characteristics of both rapid transit and commuter rail serving a metropolitan region are common in German-speaking countries, where they are known as S-Bahn. Other examples include: Lazio regional railways in Rome, the RER in France and the Elizabeth line, London Underground Metropolitan line, London Overground and Merseyrail in the UK. A comparable system in India, the Delhi RRTS, is also under construction.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The largest city is Peterborough, followed by the county town of Cambridge.\nIt is bordered by Lincolnshire to the north, Norfolk to the north-east, Suffolk to the east, Essex and Hertfordshire to the south, and Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire to the west. The historic county with land from two historic counties, Northamptonshire's Soke of Peterborough and Huntingdonshire, form the ceremonial county.\nBefore 1974, the administrative counties were called Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely and Huntingdon and Peterborough with merging under the Local Government Act 1972 in 1974, with a non-metropolitan county created. It was reformed to a two tier non-metropolitan system of the county and districts of the City of Cambridge, East Cambridgeshire, Fenland, Huntingdonshire, South Cambridgeshire and the City of Peterborough; the latter later became a unitary authority area creating a separate defined area for the ceremonial and non-metropolitan counties.\nHistory.\nCambridgeshire is noted as the site of Flag Fen in Fengate, one of the earliest-known Neolithic permanent settlements in the United Kingdom, compared in importance to Balbridie in Aberdeen, Scotland. Must Farm quarry, at Whittlesey has been described as 'Britain's Pompeii due to its relatively good condition, including the 'best-preserved Bronze Age dwellings ever found'. A great quantity of archaeological finds from the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age were made in East Cambridgeshire. Most items were found in Isleham.\nThe area was settled by the Anglo-Saxons starting in the fifth century. Genetic testing on seven skeletons found in Anglo-Saxon era graves in Hinxton and Oakington found that five were either migrants or descended from migrants from the continent, one was a native Briton, and one had both continental and native ancestry, suggesting intermarriage.\nCambridgeshire was recorded in the \"Domesday Book\" as \"Grantbridgeshire\" (or rather \"Grentebrigescire\") (related to the river Granta).\nCovering a large part of East Anglia, Cambridgeshire today is the result of several local government unifications. In 1888 when county councils were introduced, separate councils were set up, following the traditional division of Cambridgeshire, for\nIn 1965, these two administrative counties were merged to form Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely.\nUnder the Local Government Act 1972 this merged with the county to the west, Huntingdon and Peterborough, which had been formed in 1965, by the merger of Huntingdonshire with the Soke of Peterborough (the latter previously a part of Northamptonshire with its own county council). The resulting county was called simply Cambridgeshire.\nSince 1998, the City of Peterborough has been separately administered as a unitary authority area. It is associated with Cambridgeshire for ceremonial purposes such as Lieutenancy and joint functions such as policing and the fire service.\nIn 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife unofficially designated Cambridgeshire's county flower as the Pasqueflower.\nThe Cambridgeshire Regiment (nicknamed the Fen Tigers), the county-based army unit, fought in the Boer War in South Africa, the First World War and Second World War.\nDue to the county's flat terrain and proximity to the continent, during the Second World War the military built many airfields here for RAF Bomber Command, RAF Fighter Command, and the allied USAAF. In recognition of this collaboration, the Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial is located in Madingley. It is the only WWII burial ground in England for American servicemen who died during that event.\nMost English counties have nicknames for their people, such as a \"Tyke\" from Yorkshire and a \"Yellowbelly\" from Lincolnshire. The historical nicknames for people from Cambridgeshire are \"Cambridgeshire Camel\" or \"Cambridgeshire Crane\", referring to the wildfowl that were once abundant in the Fens. The term \"Fen Tigers\" is sometimes used to describe the people who live and work in the Fens.\nOriginal historical documents relating to Cambridgeshire are held by Cambridgeshire Archives. Cambridgeshire County Council Libraries maintains several Local Studies collections of printed and published materials, significantly at the Cambridgeshire Collection held in the Cambridge Central Library.\nSymbolism.\nFlag.\nCambridgeshire's county flag was made official on 1 February 2015, after the design was selected as an entry from design competition that ran during 2014. The design features three golden crowns, two on the top, one on the bottom that are separated by two wavy lines in the middle. The crowns are meant to represent East Anglia, and the two lines represent the River Cam and are in the university's colours.\nCoat of arms.\nThe coat of arms, officially adopted on 1 November 1976, features two Great bustard birds supporting the arms that contain five blue straight and wavy lines to represent the county's rivers, and the tip of a castle tower at the top. The motto at the bottom reads 'Corde uno sapientes simus' in Latin, and translates to 'Let us be wise with one heart'.\n \"See also Geology of Cambridgeshire\"\nGeography.\nLarge areas of the county are extremely low-lying and Holme Fen is notable for being the UK's lowest physical point at 2.75\u00a0m (9\u00a0ft) below sea level. The highest point of the modern administrative county is in the village of Great Chishill at 146\u00a0m (480\u00a0ft) above sea level. However, this parish was historically a part of Essex, having been moved to Cambridgeshire in boundary changes in 1895. The historic county top is close to the village of Castle Camps where a point on the disused RAF airfield reaches a height of above sea level (grid reference TL 63282 41881).\nOther prominent hills are Little Trees Hill and Wandlebury Hill (both at ) in the Gog Magog Hills, Rivey Hill above Linton, Rowley's Hill and the Madingley Hills.\nWicken Fen is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest west of Wicken. A large part of it is owned and managed by the National Trust.\nGreen belt.\nCambridgeshire contains all its green belt around the city of Cambridge, extending to places such as Waterbeach, Lode, Duxford, Little &amp; Great Abington and other communities a few miles away in nearby districts, to afford a protection from the conurbation. It was first drawn up in the 1950s.\nPolitics.\nCambridgeshire County Council is controlled by an alliance of the Liberal Democrats, the Labour Party and independent groups, while Peterborough City Council is currently controlled by a Conservative Party minority administration.\nThe county contains seven Parliamentary constituencies:\nEconomy.\nThis is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of Cambridgeshire at current basic prices published (pp.\u00a0240\u2013253) by \"Office for National Statistics\" with figures in millions of English Pounds Sterling.\nAWG plc is based in Huntingdon. The RAF has several stations in the Huntingdon and St Ives area. RAF Alconbury, three miles north of Huntingdon, is being reorganised after a period of obsolescence following the departure of the USAF, to be the focus of RAF/USAFE intelligence operations, with activities at Upwood and Molesworth being transferred there. Most of Cambridgeshire is agricultural. Close to Cambridge is the so-called Silicon Fen area of high-technology (electronics, computing and biotechnology) companies.

The inland Port of Wisbech on the River Nene is the county's only remaining port.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary.\nCambridgeshire has a comprehensive education system with over 240 state schools, not including sixth form colleges. The independent sector includes King's Ely and Wisbech Grammar School, founded in 970 and 1379 respectively, they are two of the oldest schools in the country.\nSome of the secondary schools act as Village Colleges, institutions unique to Cambridgeshire. For example, Comberton Village College.\nTertiary.\nCambridgeshire is home to a number of institutes of higher education:\nIn addition, Cambridge Regional College and Huntingdonshire Regional College both offer a limited range of higher education courses in conjunction with partner universities.\nSettlements.\nThese are the settlements in Cambridgeshire with a town charter, city status or a population over 5,000; for a complete list of settlements see list of places in Cambridgeshire.\nSee the List of Cambridgeshire settlements by population page for more detail.\nThe town of Newmarket is surrounded on three sides by Cambridgeshire, being connected by a narrow strip of land to the rest of Suffolk.\nCambridgeshire has seen 32,869 dwellings created from 2002 to 2013 and there are a further 35,360 planned new dwellings between 2016 and 2023.\nClimate.\nCambridgeshire has a maritime temperate climate which is broadly similar to the rest of the United Kingdom, though it is drier than the UK average due to its low altitude and easterly location, the prevailing southwesterly winds having already deposited moisture on higher ground further west. Average winter temperatures are cooler than the English average, due to Cambridgeshire's inland location and relative nearness to continental Europe, which results in the moderating maritime influence being less strong. Snowfall is slightly more common than in western areas, due to the relative winter coolness and easterly winds bringing occasional snow from the North Sea. In summer temperatures are average or slightly above, due to less cloud cover. It reaches on around ten days each year, and is comparable to parts of Kent and East Anglia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCulture.\nSports.\nVarious forms of football have been popular in Cambridgeshire since medieval times at least. In 1579 one match played at Chesterton between townspeople and University of Cambridge students ended in a violent brawl that led the Vice-Chancellor to issue a decree forbidding them to play \"footeball\" outside of college grounds. During the nineteenth century, several formulations of the laws of football, known as the Cambridge rules, were created by students at the university. One of these codes, dating from 1863, had a significant influence on the creation of the original laws of the Football Association.\nCambridgeshire is also the birthplace of bandy, now an IOC accepted sport. According to documents from 1813, Bury Fen Bandy Club was undefeated for 100 years. A member of the club, Charles Goodman Tebbutt, wrote down the first official rules in 1882. Tebbutt was instrumental in spreading the sport to many countries. Great Britain Bandy Association is based in Cambridgeshire.\nFen skating is a traditional form of skating in the Fenland. The National Ice Skating Association was set up in Cambridge in 1879, they took the top Fen skaters to the world speedskating championships where James Smart (skater) became world champion.\nOn 6\u20137 June 2015, the inaugural Tour of Cambridgeshire cycle race took place on closed roads across the county.

{"id": "6290", "revid": "45667218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6290", "title": "Christian Goldbach", "text": "German mathematician\nChristian Goldbach (; ]; 18 March 1690 \u2013 20 November 1764) was a Prussian mathematician connected with some important research mainly in number theory; he also studied law and took an interest in and a role in the Russian court. After traveling around Europe in his early life, he landed in Russia in 1725 as a professor at the newly founded Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Goldbach jointly led the Academy in 1737. However, he relinquished duties in the Academy in 1742 and worked in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs until his death in 1764. He is remembered today for Goldbach's conjecture and the Goldbach\u2013Euler Theorem. He had a close friendship with famous mathematician Leonard Euler, serving as inspiration for Euler's mathematical pursuits.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBorn in the Duchy of Prussia's capital K\u00f6nigsberg, part of Brandenburg-Prussia, Goldbach was the son of a pastor. He studied at the Royal Albertus University. After finishing his studies he went on long educational voyages from 1710 to 1724 through Europe, visiting other German states, England, The Netherlands, Italy, and France, meeting with many famous mathematicians, such as Gottfried Leibniz, Leonhard Euler, and Nicholas I Bernoulli. These acquaintances started Goldbach's interest in mathematics. He briefly attended Oxford University in 1713 and, while he was there, Goldbach learned mathematics from mathematical scholars John Wallis and Isaac Newton. Also, Goldbach's travels fostered his interest in philology, archaeology, metaphysics, ballistics, and medicine. Between 1717 and 1724, Goldbach published his first few papers which, while minor, credited his mathematical ability. Back in K\u00f6nigsberg he got acquainted with Georg Bernhard Bilfinger and Jakob Hermann.\nSaint Petersburg Academy of Sciences.\nGoldbach followed Bilfinger and Hermann to the newly opened St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1725. Christian Wolff had invited and had written recommendations for all the Germans who traveled to Saint Petersburg for the academy except Goldbach. Goldbach wrote to the president-designate of the academy, petitioning for a position in the academy, using his past publications and knowledge in medicine and law as qualifications. Goldbach was then hired to a five-year contract as a professor of mathematics and historian of the academy. As historian of the academy, he recorded each academy meeting from the opening of the school in 1725 until January 1728. Goldbach worked with famous mathematicians like Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli, and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. Goldbach also played a part in Euler's decision to academically pursue mathematics instead of medicine, cementing mathematics as the premier research field of the academy in the 1730's. \nRussian government work.\nIn 1728, when Peter II became Tsar of Russia, Goldbach became Peter II and Anna's, Peter II's cousin, tutor. Peter II moved the Russian court from St. Petersburg to Moscow in 1729, so Goldbach followed him to Moscow. Goldbach started a correspondence with Euler in 1729, in which some of Goldbach's most important mathematics contributions can be found. Upon Peter II's death in 1730, Goldbach stopped teaching but continued to assist Empress Anna. In 1732, Goldbach returned to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences and stayed in the Russian government when Anna moved the court back to St. Petersburg. Upon return to the academy, Goldbach was named corresponding secretary. With Goldbach's return, his friend Euler continued his teaching and research at the academy as well. Then, in 1737, Goldbach and J.D. Schumacher took over the administration of the academy. Also, Goldbach took on duty in Russian court under Empress Anna. He managed to retain his influence in court after the death of Anna and the rule of Empress Elizabeth. In 1742 he entered the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stepping way from the academy once more. Goldbach was gifted land and increased salary for his good work and rise in the Russian government. In 1760, Goldbach created new guidelines for the education of the royal children which would remain for 100 years. He died on 20 November 1764, aged 74, in Moscow.\nChristian Goldbach was multilingual \u2013 he wrote a diary in German and Latin, his letters were written in German, Latin, French, and Italian and for official documents he used Russian, German and Latin.\nContributions.\nGoldbach is most noted for his correspondence with Leibniz, Euler, and Bernoulli, especially in his 1742 letter to Euler stating his Goldbach's conjecture. He also studied and proved some theorems on perfect powers, such as the Goldbach\u2013Euler theorem, and made several notable contributions to analysis. He also proved a result concerning Fermat numbers that is called Goldbach's theorem.\nImpact on Euler.\nIt is Goldbach and Euler's correspondence that contains some of Goldbach's most important contributions to mathematics, specifically number theory. Goldbach and Euler's friendship survived Goldbach's move to Moscow in 1728 and communication ensued. Their correspondence spanned 196 letters over 35 years written in Latin, German, and French. These letters spanned a wide range of topics, including various mathematics topics. Goldbach was the leading influence on Euler's interest and work in number theory. Most of the letters discuss Euler's research in number theory as well as differential calculus. Until the late 1750's, Euler's correspondence on his number theory research was almost exclusively with Goldbach.\nGoldbach's earlier mathematical work and ideas in letters to Euler directly influenced some of Euler's work. In 1729, Euler solved two problems pertaining to sequences which had stumped Goldbach. Ensuingly, Euler outlined the solutions to Goldbach. Also, in 1729 Goldbach closely approximated the Basel problem, which prompted Euler's interest and concurring breakthrough solution. Goldbach, through his letters, kept Euler focused on number theory in the 1730's by discussing Fermat's conjecture with Euler. Euler subsequently offered a proof to the conjecture, crediting Goldbach with introducing him to the subfield. Euler proceeded to write 560 writings, published posthumously in four volumes of Opera omnia, with Goldbach's influence guiding some of the writings. Goldbach's famous conjecture and his writings with Euler prove him to be one of a handful of mathematicians who understood complex number theory in light of Fermat's revolutionary ideas on the topic.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6291", "revid": "34639976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6291", "title": "Roman censor", "text": "Roman magistrate and census administrator\nThe censor was a magistrate in ancient Rome who was responsible for maintaining the census, supervising public morality, and overseeing certain aspects of the government's finances.\nThe power of the censor was absolute: no magistrate could oppose his decisions, and only another censor who succeeded him could cancel those decisions.\nThe censor's regulation of public morality is the origin of the modern meaning of the words \"censor\" and \"censorship\".\nEarly history of the magistracy.\nThe \"census\" was first instituted by Servius Tullius, sixth king of Rome, c.\u2009575\u2013535 BC. After the abolition of the monarchy and the founding of the Republic in 509 BC, the consuls had responsibility for the census until 443 BC. In 442 BC, no consuls were elected, but tribunes with consular power were appointed instead. This was a move by the plebeians to try to attain higher magistracies: only patricians could be elected consuls, while some military tribunes were plebeians. To prevent the possibility of plebeians obtaining control of the census, the patricians removed the right to take the census from the consuls and tribunes, and appointed for this duty two magistrates, called \"censores\" (censors), elected exclusively from the patricians in Rome. \nThe magistracy continued to be controlled by patricians until 351 BC, when Gaius Marcius Rutilus was appointed the first plebeian censor. Twelve years later, in 339 BC, one of the Publilian laws required that one censor had to be a plebeian. Despite this, no plebeian censor performed the solemn purification of the people (the \"lustrum\"; Livy \"Periochae\" 13) until 280 BC. In 131 BC, for the first time, both censors were plebeians.\nThe reason for having two censors was that the two consuls had previously taken the census together. If one of the censors died during his term of office, another was chosen to replace him, just as with consuls. This happened only once, in 393 BC. However, the Gauls captured Rome in that \"lustrum\" (five-year period), and the Romans thereafter regarded such replacement as \"an offense against religion\". From then on, if one of the censors died, his colleague resigned, and two new censors were chosen to replace them.\nInitially, the office of censor was limited to eighteen months by a law of the dictator Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus; and the office therefore was of less importance in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. However, during the censorship of Appius Claudius Caecus (312\u2013308 BC) the prestige of the censorship massively increased. Caecus built the first-ever Roman road (the Via Appia) and the first Roman aqueduct (the Aqua Appia), both named after him. He changed the organisation of the Roman tribes and was the first censor to draw the list of senators. He also advocated the founding of Roman \"coloniae\" throughout Latium and Campania to support the Roman war effort in the Second Samnite War. With these efforts and reforms, Appius Claudius Caecus was able to hold the censorship for a whole \"lustrum\" (five-year period), and the office of censor, subsequently entrusted with various important duties, eventually attained one of the highest political statuses in the Roman Republic, second only to that of the consuls.\nElection.\nThe censors were elected in the Centuriate Assembly, which met under the presidency of a consul. Barthold Niebuhr suggests that the censors were at first elected by the Curiate Assembly, and that the Assembly's selections were confirmed by the Centuriate, but William Smith believes that \"there is no authority for this supposition, and the truth of it depends entirely upon the correctness of [Niebuhr's] views respecting the election of the consuls\". Both censors had to be elected on the same day, and accordingly if the voting for the second was not finished in the same day, the election of the first was invalidated, and a new assembly had to be held.\nThe assembly for the election of the censors was held under different auspices from those at the election of the consuls and praetors, so the censors were not regarded as their colleagues, although they likewise possessed the \"maxima auspicia\". The assembly was held by the new consuls shortly after they began their term of office; and the censors, as soon as they were elected and the censorial power had been granted to them by a decree of the Centuriate Assembly (\"lex centuriata\"), were fully installed in their office.\nAs a general principle, the only ones eligible for the office of censor were those who had previously been consuls, but there were a few exceptions. At first, there was no law to prevent a person being censor twice, but the only person who was elected to the office twice was Gaius Marcius Rutilus in 265 BC. In that year, he originated a law stating that no one could be elected censor twice. In consequence of this, he received the \"cognomen\" of Censorinus.\nAttributes.\nThe censorship differed from all other Roman magistracies in the length of office. The censors were originally chosen for a whole \"lustrum\" (a period of five years), but as early as ten years after its institution (433 BC) their office was limited to eighteen months by a law of Dictator Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus. The censors were also unique with respect to rank and dignity. They had no \"imperium\", and accordingly no lictors. Their rank was granted to them by the Centuriate Assembly, and not by the \"curiae\", and in that respect they were inferior in power to the consuls and praetors.\nNotwithstanding this, the censorship was regarded as the highest dignity in the state, with the exception of the dictatorship; it was a \"sacred magistracy\" (\"sanctus magistratus\"), to which the deepest reverence was due. The high rank and dignity which the censorship obtained was due to the various important duties gradually entrusted to it, and especially to its possessing the \"regimen morum\", or general control over the conduct and the morals of the citizens. In the exercise of this power, they were regulated solely by their own views of duty, and were not responsible to any other power in the state.\nThe censors possessed the official stool called a \"curule chair\" (\"sella curulis\"), but some doubt exists with respect to their official dress. A well-known passage of Polybius describes the use of the \"imagines\" at funerals; we may conclude that a consul or praetor wore the purple-bordered \"toga praetexta\", one who triumphed the embroidered \"toga picta\", and the censor a purple toga peculiar to him, but other writers speak of their official dress as being the same as that of the other higher magistrates. The funeral of a censor was always conducted with great pomp and splendour, and hence a \"censorial funeral\" (\"funus censorium\") was voted even to the emperors.\nAbolition.\nThe censorship continued in existence for 421 years, from 443 BC to 22 BC, but during this period, many \"lustra\" passed by without any censor being chosen at all. According to one statement, the office was abolished by Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Although the authority on which this statement rests is not of much weight, the fact itself is probable, since there was no census during the two \"lustra\" which elapsed from Sulla's dictatorship to Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey)'s first consulship (82\u201370 BC), and any strict \"imposition of morals\" would have been found inconvenient to the aristocracy that supported Sulla.\nIf the censorship had been done away with by Sulla, it was at any rate restored in the consulship of Pompey and Marcus Licinius Crassus. Its power was limited by one of the laws of the tribune Publius Clodius Pulcher (58 BC), which prescribed certain regular forms of proceeding before the censors in expelling a person from the Roman Senate, and required that the censors be in agreement to exact this punishment. This law, however, was repealed in the third consulship of Pompey in 52 BC, on the urging of his colleague Q. Caecilius Metellus Scipio, but the office of the censorship never recovered its former power and influence.\nDuring the civil wars which followed soon afterwards, no censors were elected; it was only after a long interval that they were again appointed, namely in 23 BC, when Augustus caused Lucius Munatius Plancus and Aemilius Lepidus Paullus to fill the office. This was the last time that such magistrates were appointed; the emperors in future discharged the duties of their office under the name of Praefectura Morum (\"prefect of the morals\").\nSome of the emperors sometimes took the name of censor when they held a census of the Roman people; this was the case with Claudius, who appointed the elder Lucius Vitellius as his colleague, and with Vespasian, who likewise had a colleague in his son Titus. Domitian assumed the title of \"perpetual censor\" (\"censor perpetuus\"), but this example was not imitated by succeeding emperors. In the reign of Decius, we find the elder Valerian nominated to the censorship, but Valerian was never actually elected censor.\nDuties.\nThe duties of the censors may be divided into three classes, all of which were closely connected with one another:\nThe original business of the censorship was at first of a much more limited kind, and was restricted almost entirely to taking the census, but the possession of this power gradually brought with it fresh power and new duties, as is shown below. A general view of these duties is briefly expressed in the following passage of Cicero: \"Censores populi aevitates, soboles, familias pecuniasque censento: urbis templa, vias, aquas, aerarium, vectigalia tuento: populique partes in tribus distribunto: exin pecunias, aevitates, ordines patiunto: equitum, peditumque prolem describunto: caelibes esse prohibento: mores populi regunto: probrum in senatu ne relinquunto.\" This can be translated as: \"The Censors are to determine the generations, origins, families, and properties of the people; they are to (watch over/protect) the city's temples, roads, waters, treasury, and taxes; they are to divide the people into three parts; next, they are to (allow/approve) the properties, generations, and ranks [of the people]; they are to describe the offspring of knights and footsoldiers; they are to forbid being unmarried; they are to guide the behavior of the people; they are not to overlook abuse in the Senate.\" \nCensus.\nThe Census, the first and principal duty of the censors, was always held in the Campus Martius, and from the year 435 BC onwards, in a special building called Villa publica, which was erected for that purpose by the second pair of censors, Gaius Furius Pacilus Fusus and Marcus Geganius Macerinus. An account of the formalities with which the census was opened is given in a fragment of the \"Tabulae Censoriae\", preserved by Varro. After the auspices had been taken, the citizens were summoned by a public crier to appear before the censors. Each tribe was called up separately, and the names in each tribe were probably taken according to the lists previously made out by the tribunes of the tribes. Every \"pater familias\" had to appear in person before the censors, who were seated in their curule chairs, and those names were taken first which were considered to be of good omen, such as Valerius, Salvius, Statorius, etc.\nThe Census was conducted according to the judgement of the censor (\"ad arbitrium censoris\"), but the censors laid down certain rules, sometimes called \"leges censui censendo\", in which mention was made of the different kinds of property subject to the census, and in what way their value was to be estimated. According to these laws, each citizen had to give an account of himself, of his family, and of his property upon oath, \"declared from the heart\". First he had to give his full name (\"praenomen\", \"nomen\", and \"cognomen\") and that of his father, or if he were a \"libertus\" (\"freedman\") that of his patron, and he was likewise obliged to state his age. He was then asked, \"You, declaring from your heart, do you have a wife?\" and if married he had to give the name of his wife, and likewise the number, names, and ages of his children, if any. Single women and orphans were represented by their guardians; their names were entered in separate lists, and they were not included in the sum total of heads.\nAfter a citizen had stated his name, age, family, etc., he then had to give an account of all his property, so far as it was subject to the census. Only such things were liable to the census (\"censui censendo\") as were property according to the Quiritarian law. At first, each citizen appears to have merely given the value of his whole property in general without entering into details; but it soon became the practice to give a minute specification of each article, as well as the general value of the whole. Land formed the most important article of the census, but public land, the possession of which only belonged to a citizen, was excluded as not being Quiritarian property. Judging from the practice of the imperial period, it was the custom to give a most minute specification of all such land as a citizen held according to the Quiritarian law. He had to state the name and location of the land, and to specify what portion of it was arable, what meadow, what vineyard, and what olive-ground: and of the land thus described, he had to give his assessment of its value.\nSlaves and cattle formed the next most important item. The censors also possessed the right of calling for a return of such objects as had not usually been given in, such as clothing, jewels, and carriages. It has been doubted by some modern writers whether the censors possessed the power of setting a higher valuation on the property than the citizens themselves gave, but given the discretionary nature of the censors' powers, and the necessity almost that existed, in order to prevent fraud, that the right of making a surcharge should be vested in somebody's hands, it is likely that the censors had this power. It is moreover expressly stated that on one occasion they made an extravagant surcharge on articles of luxury; and even if they did not enter in their books the property of a person at a higher value than he returned it, they accomplished the same end by compelling him to pay a tax upon the property at a higher rate than others. The tax was usually one per thousand upon the property entered in the books of the censors, but on one occasion the censors compelled a person to pay eight per thousand as a punishment.\nA person who voluntarily absented himself from the census was considered \"incensus\" and subject to the severest punishment. Servius Tullius is said to have threatened such individuals with imprisonment and death, and in the Republican period he might be sold by the state as a slave. In the later period of the Republic, a person who was absent from the census might be represented by another, and be thus registered by the censors. Whether the soldiers who were absent on service had to appoint a representative is uncertain. In ancient times, the sudden outbreaks of war prevented the census from being taken, because a large number of the citizens would necessarily be absent. It is supposed from a passage in Livy that in later times the censors sent commissioners into the provinces with full powers to take the census of the Roman soldiers there, but this seems to have been a special case. It is, on the contrary, probable from the way in which Cicero pleads the absence of Archias from Rome with the army under Lucullus, as a sufficient reason for his not having been enrolled in the census, that service in the army was a valid excuse for absence.\nAfter the censors had received the names of all the citizens with the amount of their property, they then had to make out the lists of the tribes, and also of the classes and centuries; for by the legislation of Servius Tullius the position of each citizen in the state was determined by the amount of his property (Comitia Centuriata). These lists formed a most important part of the \"Tabulae Censoriae\", under which name were included all the documents connected in any way with the discharge of the censors' duties. These lists, insofar as they were connected with the finances of the state, were deposited in the \"aerarium\", located in the Temple of Saturn; but the regular depository for all the archives of the censors was in earlier times the Atrium Libertatis, near the Villa publica, and in later times the temple of the Nymphs.\nBesides the division of the citizens into tribes, centuries, and classes, the censors had also to make out the lists of the senators for the ensuing five years, or until new censors were appointed, striking out the names of such as they considered unworthy, and making additions to the body from those who were qualified. In the same manner they held a review of the \"equites\" who received a horse from public funds (\"equites equo publico\"), and added and removed names as they judged proper. They also confirmed the \"princeps senatus\", or appointed a new one. The princeps himself had to be a former censor. After the lists had been completed, the number of citizens was counted up, and the sum total announced. Accordingly, we find that in the account of a census, the number of citizens is likewise usually given. They are in such cases spoken of as \"capita\" (\"heads\"), sometimes with the addition of the word \"civium\" (\"of the citizens\"), and sometimes not. Hence, to be registered in the census was the same thing as \"having a head\" (\"caput habere\").\nCensus beyond Rome.\nA census was sometimes taken in the provinces, even under the Republic. The emperor sent into the provinces special officers called \"censitores\" to take the census; but the duty was sometimes discharged by the Imperial \"legati\". The \"censitores\" were assisted by subordinate officers, called \"censuales\", who made out the lists, etc. In Rome, the census was still taken under the Empire, but the old ceremonies connected with it were no longer performed, and the ceremony of the \"lustratio\" was not performed after the time of Vespasian. The jurists Paulus and Ulpian each wrote works on the census in the imperial period; and several extracts from these works are given in a chapter in the \"Digest\" (50 15). \nOther uses of census.\nThe word \"census\", besides the conventional meaning of \"valuation\" of a person's estate, has other meaning in Rome; it could refer to: \n\"Regimen morum\".\nKeeping the public morals (\"regimen morum\", or in the Empire \"cura morum\" or \"praefectura morum\") was the second most important branch of the censors' duties, and the one which caused their office to be one of the most revered and the most dreaded; hence they were also known as \"castigatores\" (\"chastisers\"). It naturally grew out of the right which they possessed of excluding persons from the lists of citizens; for, as has been well remarked, \"they would, in the first place, be the sole judges of many questions of fact, such as whether a citizen had the qualifications required by law or custom for the rank which he claimed, or whether he had ever incurred any judicial sentence, which rendered him infamous: but from thence the transition was easy, according to Roman notions, to the decisions of questions of right; such as whether a citizen was really worthy of retaining his rank, whether he had not committed some act as justly degrading as those which incurred the sentence of the law.\" \nIn this manner, the censors gradually assumed at least nominal complete superintendence over the whole public and private life of every citizen. They were constituted as the conservators of public morality; they were not simply to prevent crime or particular acts of immorality, but rather to maintain the traditional Roman character, ethics, and habits (\"mos majorum\")\u2014\"regimen morum\" also encompassed this protection of traditional ways, which was called in the times of the Empire \"cura\" (\"supervision\") or \"praefectura\" (\"command\"). The punishment inflicted by the censors in the exercise of this branch of their duties was called \"nota\" (\"mark, letter\") or \"notatio\", or \"animadversio censoria\" (\"censorial reproach\"). In inflicting it, they were guided only by their conscientious convictions of duty; they had to take an oath that they would act biased by neither partiality nor favour; and, in addition to this, they were bound in every case to state in their lists, opposite the name of the guilty citizen, the cause of the punishment inflicted on him, \"subscriptio censoria\".\nThis part of the censors' office invested them with a peculiar kind of jurisdiction, which in many respects resembled the exercise of public opinion in modern times; for there are innumerable actions which, though acknowledged by everyone to be prejudicial and immoral, still do not come within the reach of the positive laws of a country; as often said, \"immorality does not equal illegality\". Even in cases of real crimes, the positive laws frequently punish only the particular offence, while in public opinion the offender, even after he has undergone punishment, is still incapacitated for certain honours and distinctions which are granted only to persons of unblemished character.\nHence, the Roman censors might brand a man with their \"censorial mark\" (\"nota censoria\") in case he had been convicted of a crime in an ordinary court of justice, and had already suffered punishment for it. The consequence of such a \"nota\" was only \"ignominia\" and not \"infamia\". \"Infamia\" and the censorial verdict was not a \"judicium\" or \"res judicata\", for its effects were not lasting, but might be removed by the following censors, or by a \"lex\" (roughly \"law\"). A censorial mark was moreover not valid unless both censors agreed. The \"ignominia\" was thus only a transitory reduction of status, which does not even appear to have deprived a magistrate of his office, and certainly did not disqualify persons labouring under it for obtaining a magistracy, for being appointed as \"judices\" by the praetor, or for serving in the Roman army. Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus was thus, notwithstanding the reproach of the censors (\"animadversio censoria\"), made dictator.\nA person might be branded with a censorial mark in a variety of cases, which it would be impossible to specify, as in a great many instances it depended upon the discretion of the censors and the view they took of a case; and sometimes even one set of censors would overlook an offence which was severely chastised by their successors. But the offences which are recorded to have been punished by the censors are of a threefold nature.\nA person who had been branded with a \"nota censoria\", might, if he considered himself wronged, endeavour to prove his innocence to the censors, and if he did not succeed, he might try to gain the protection of one of the censors, that he might intercede on his behalf.\nPunishments.\nThe punishments inflicted by the censors generally differed according to the station which a man occupied, though sometimes a person of the highest rank might suffer all the punishments at once, by being degraded to the lowest class of citizens. The punishments are generally divided into four classes:\nIt was this authority of the Roman censors which eventually developed into the modern meaning of \"censor\" and \"censorship\"\u2014i.e., officials who review published material and forbid the publication of material judged to be contrary to \"public morality\" as the term is interpreted in a given political and social environment.\nAdministration of the finances of the state.\nThe administration of the state's finances was another part of the censors' office. In the first place the \"tributum\", or property-tax, had to be paid by each citizen according to the amount of his property registered in the census, and, accordingly, the regulation of this tax naturally fell under the jurisdiction of the censors. They also had the superintendence of all the other revenues of the state, the \"vectigalia\", such as the tithes paid for the public lands, the salt works, the mines, the customs, etc.\nThe censors typically auctioned off to the highest bidder for the space of a \"lustrum\" the collection of the tithes and taxes (tax farming). This auctioning was called \"venditio\" or \"locatio\", and seems to have taken place in the month of March, in a public place in Rome The terms on which they were let, together with the rights and duties of the purchasers, were all specified in the \"leges censoriae\", which the censors published in every case before the bidding commenced. For further particulars see Publicani.\nThe censors also possessed the right, though probably not without the assent of the Senate, of imposing new \"vectigalia\", and even of selling the land belonging to the state. It would thus appear that it was the duty of the censors to bring forward a budget for a five-year period, and to take care that the income of the state was sufficient for its expenditure during that time. In part, their duties resembled those of a modern minister of finance. The censors, however, did not receive the revenues of the state. All the public money was paid into the \"aerarium\", which was entirely under the jurisdiction of the Senate; and all disbursements were made by order of this body, which employed the quaestors as its officers.\nOverseeing public works.\nIn one important department, the public works, the censors were entrusted with the expenditure of the public money (though the actual payments were no doubt made by the quaestors).\nThe censors had the general superintendence of all the public buildings and works (\"opera publica\"), and to meet the expenses connected with this part of their duties, the Senate voted them a certain sum of money or certain revenues, to which they were restricted, but which they might at the same time employ according to their discretion. They had to see that the temples and all other public buildings were in a good state of repair, that no public places were encroached upon by the occupation of private persons, and that the aqueducts, roads, drains, etc. were properly attended to.\nThe repairs of the public works and the keeping of them in proper condition were let out by the censors by public auction to the lowest bidder, just as the \"vectigalia\" were let out to the highest bidder. These expenses were called \"ultrotributa\", and hence we frequently find \"vectigalia\" and \"ultrotributa\" contrasted with one another. The persons who undertook the contract were called \"conductores\", \"mancipes\", \"redemptores\", \"susceptores\", etc., and the duties they had to discharge were specified in the Leges Censoriae. The censors had also to superintend the expenses connected with the worship of the gods, even for instance the feeding of the sacred geese in the Capitol; these various tasks were also let out on contract. It was ordinary for censors to expend large amounts of money (\u201cby far the largest and most extensive\u201d of the state) in their public works.\nBesides keeping existing public buildings and facilities in a proper state of repair, the censors were also in charge of constructing new ones, either for ornament or utility, both in Rome and in other parts of Italy, such as temples, basilicae, theatres, porticoes, fora, aqueducts, town walls, harbours, bridges, cloacae, roads, etc. These works were either performed by them jointly, or they divided between them the money, which had been granted to them by the Senate. They were let out to contractors, like the other works mentioned above, and when they were completed, the censors had to see that the work was performed in accordance with the contract: this was called \"opus probare\" or \"in acceptum referre\".\nThe first ever Roman road, the Via Appia, and the first Roman aqueduct, the Aqua Appia, were all constructed under the censorship of Appius Claudius Caecus, one of the most influential censors.\nThe aediles had likewise a superintendence over the public buildings, and it is not easy to define with accuracy the respective duties of the censors and aediles, but it may be remarked in general that the superintendence of the aediles had more of a police character, while that of the censors were more financial in subject matter.\nLustrum.\nAfter the censors had performed their various duties and taken the five-yearly census, the \"lustrum\", a solemn purification of the people, followed. When the censors entered upon their office, they drew lots to see which of them should perform this purification; but both censors were of course obliged to be present at the ceremony.\nLong after the Roman census was no longer taken, the Latin word \"lustrum\" has survived, and been adopted in some modern languages, in the derived sense of a period of five years, i.e., half a decennium.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Equivalently, a convex set or a convex region is a subset that intersects every line into a single line segment (possibly empty).\nFor example, a solid cube is a convex set, but anything that is hollow or has an indent, for example, a crescent shape, is not convex.\nThe boundary of a convex set is always a convex curve. The intersection of all the convex sets that contain a given subset A of Euclidean space is called the convex hull of A. It is the smallest convex set containing A.\nA convex function is a real-valued function defined on an interval with the property that its epigraph (the set of points on or above the graph of the function) is a convex set. Convex minimization is a subfield of optimization that studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets. The branch of mathematics devoted to the study of properties of convex sets and convex functions is called convex analysis.\nThe notion of a convex set can be generalized as described below.\nDefinitions.\nLet S be a vector space or an affine space over the real numbers, or, more generally, over some ordered field (this includes Euclidean spaces, which are affine spaces). A subset C of S is convex if, for all x and y in C, the line segment connecting x and y is included in C. \nThis means that the affine combination (1 \u2212 \"t\")\"x\" + \"ty\" belongs to C for all x,y in C and t in the interval [0, 1]. This implies that convexity is invariant under affine transformations. Further, it implies that a convex set in a real or complex topological vector space is path-connected (and therefore also connected).\nA set C is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;strictly convex if every point on the line segment connecting x and y other than the endpoints is inside the topological interior of C. A closed convex subset is strictly convex if and only if every one of its boundary points is an extreme point.\nA set C is absolutely convex if it is convex and balanced.\nExamples.\nThe convex subsets of R (the set of real numbers) are the intervals and the points of R. Some examples of convex subsets of the Euclidean plane are solid regular polygons, solid triangles, and intersections of solid triangles. Some examples of convex subsets of a Euclidean 3-dimensional space are the Archimedean solids and the Platonic solids. The Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra are examples of non-convex sets.\nNon-convex set.\nA set that is not convex is called a \"non-convex set\". A polygon that is not a convex polygon is sometimes called a concave polygon, and some sources more generally use the term \"concave set\" to mean a non-convex set, but most authorities prohibit this usage.\nThe complement of a convex set, such as the epigraph of a concave function, is sometimes called a \"reverse convex set\", especially in the context of mathematical optimization.\nProperties.\nGiven r points \"u\"1, ..., \"ur\" in a convex set S, and r\nnonnegative numbers \"\u03bb\"1, ..., \"\u03bbr\" such that \"\u03bb\"1 + ... + \"\u03bbr\" \n 1, the affine combination \nformula_1\nbelongs to S. As the definition of a convex set is the case \"r\" = 2, this property characterizes convex sets.\nSuch an affine combination is called a convex combination of \"u\"1, ..., \"ur\".\nIntersections and unions.\nThe collection of convex subsets of a vector space, an affine space, or a Euclidean space has the following properties:\nClosed convex sets.\nClosed convex sets are convex sets that contain all their limit points. They can be characterised as the intersections of \"closed half-spaces\" (sets of point in space that lie on and to one side of a hyperplane).\nFrom what has just been said, it is clear that such intersections are convex, and they will also be closed sets. To prove the converse, i.e., every closed convex set may be represented as such intersection, one needs the supporting hyperplane theorem in the form that for a given closed convex set C and point P outside it, there is a closed half-space H that contains C and not P. The supporting hyperplane theorem is a special case of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem of functional analysis.\nConvex sets and rectangles.\nLet C be a convex body in the plane (a convex set whose interior is non-empty). We can inscribe a rectangle \"r\" in C such that a homothetic copy \"R\" of \"r\" is circumscribed about C. The positive homothety ratio is at most 2 and:\nformula_2\nBlaschke-Santal\u00f3 diagrams.\nThe set formula_3 of all planar convex bodies can be parameterized in terms of the convex body diameter \"D\", its inradius \"r\" (the biggest circle contained in the convex body) and its circumradius \"R\" (the smallest circle containing the convex body). In fact, this set can be described by the set of inequalities given by\nformula_4\nformula_5\nformula_6\nformula_7\nand can be visualized as the image of the function \"g\" that maps a convex body to the R2 point given by (\"r\"/\"R\", \"D\"/2\"R\"). The image of this function is known a (\"r\", \"D\", \"R\") Blachke-Santal\u00f3 diagram.\nAlternatively, the set formula_3 can also be parametrized by its width (the smallest distance between any two different parallel support hyperplanes), perimeter and area.\nOther properties.\nLet \"X\" be a topological vector space and formula_9 be convex. \nConvex hulls and Minkowski sums.\nConvex hulls.\nEvery subset A of the vector space is contained within a smallest convex set (called the convex hull of A), namely the intersection of all convex sets containing A. The convex-hull operator Conv() has the characteristic properties of a hull operator:\n Conv(\"S\").\nThe convex-hull operation is needed for the set of convex sets to form a lattice, in which the \"join\" operation is the convex hull of the union of two convex sets\nformula_20\nThe intersection of any collection of convex sets is itself convex, so the convex subsets of a (real or complex) vector space form a complete lattice.\nMinkowski addition.\nIn a real vector-space, the \"Minkowski sum\" of two (non-empty) sets, \"S\"1 and \"S\"2, is defined to be the set \"S\"1\u00a0+\u00a0\"S\"2 formed by the addition of vectors element-wise from the summand-sets\nformula_21\nMore generally, the \"Minkowski sum\" of a finite family of (non-empty) sets \"Sn\" is the set formed by element-wise addition of vectors\nformula_22\nFor Minkowski\u00a0addition, the \"zero set\"\u00a0{0} containing only the zero\u00a0vector\u00a00 has special importance: For every non-empty subset\u00a0S of a vector space\nformula_23\nin algebraic terminology, {0} is the identity element of Minkowski addition (on the collection of non-empty sets).\nConvex hulls of Minkowski sums.\nMinkowski addition behaves well with respect to the operation of taking convex hulls, as shown by the following proposition:\nLet \"S\"1, \"S\"2 be subsets of a real vector-space, the convex hull of their Minkowski sum is the Minkowski sum of their convex hulls\nformula_24\nThis result holds more generally for each finite collection of non-empty sets:\nformula_25\nIn mathematical terminology, the operations of Minkowski summation and of forming convex hulls are commuting operations.\nMinkowski sums of convex sets.\nThe Minkowski sum of two compact convex sets is compact. The sum of a compact convex set and a closed convex set is closed.\nThe following famous theorem, proved by Dieudonn\u00e9 in 1966, gives a sufficient condition for the difference of two closed convex subsets to be closed. It uses the concept of a recession cone of a non-empty convex subset \"S\", defined as:\nformula_26\nwhere this set is a convex cone containing formula_27 and satisfying formula_28. Note that if \"S\" is closed and convex then formula_29 is closed and for all formula_30,\nformula_31\nTheorem (Dieudonn\u00e9). Let \"A\" and \"B\" be non-empty, closed, and convex subsets of a locally convex topological vector space such that formula_32 is a linear subspace. If \"A\" or \"B\" is locally compact then \"A\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"B\" is closed.\nGeneralizations and extensions for convexity.\nThe notion of convexity in the Euclidean space may be generalized by modifying the definition in some or other aspects. The common name \"generalized convexity\" is used, because the resulting objects retain certain properties of convex sets.\nStar-convex (star-shaped) sets.\nLet C be a set in a real or complex vector space. C is star convex (star-shaped) if there exists an \"x\"0 in C such that the line segment from \"x\"0 to any point y in C is contained in C. Hence a non-empty convex set is always star-convex but a star-convex set is not always convex.\nOrthogonal convexity.\nAn example of generalized convexity is orthogonal convexity.\nA set S in the Euclidean space is called orthogonally convex or ortho-convex, if any segment parallel to any of the coordinate axes connecting two points of S lies totally within S. It is easy to prove that an intersection of any collection of orthoconvex sets is orthoconvex. Some other properties of convex sets are valid as well.\nNon-Euclidean geometry.\nThe definition of a convex set and a convex hull extends naturally to geometries which are not Euclidean by defining a geodesically convex set to be one that contains the geodesics joining any two points in the set.\nOrder topology.\nConvexity can be extended for a totally ordered set X endowed with the order topology.\nLet \"Y\" \u2286 \"X\". The subspace Y is a convex set if for each pair of points \"a\", \"b\" in Y such that \"a\" \u2264 \"b\", the interval [\"a\", \"b\"] \n {\"x\" \u2208 \"X\" | \"a\" \u2264 \"x\" \u2264 \"b\"} is contained in Y. That is, Y is convex if and only if for all \"a\", \"b\" in Y, \"a\" \u2264 \"b\" implies [\"a\", \"b\"] \u2286 \"Y\".\nA convex set is not connected in general: a counter-example is given by the subspace {1,2,3} in Z, which is both convex and not connected.\nConvexity spaces.\nThe notion of convexity may be generalised to other objects, if certain properties of convexity are selected as axioms.\nGiven a set X, a convexity over X is a collection \"\ud835\udc9e\" of subsets of X satisfying the following axioms:\nThe elements of \"\ud835\udc9e\" are called convex sets and the pair (\"X\", \"\ud835\udc9e\") is called a convexity space. For the ordinary convexity, the first two axioms hold, and the third one is trivial.\nFor an alternative definition of abstract convexity, more suited to discrete geometry, see the \"convex geometries\" associated with antimatroids.\nConvex spaces.\nConvexity can be generalised as an abstract algebraic structure: a space is convex if it is possible to take convex combinations of points.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also part of the largest urban agglomeration in Africa, the Arab world and the Middle East: The Greater Cairo metropolitan area, with a population of 21.9 million, is the 12th-largest in the world by population. Cairo is associated with ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are located in its geographical area. Located near the Nile Delta, the city first developed as Fustat, a settlement founded after the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 next to an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon. Under the Fatimid dynasty, Cairo was founded nearby in 969. It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (12th\u201316th centuries). Cairo has long been a centre of the region's political and cultural life, and is titled \"the city of a thousand minarets\" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo's historic center was awarded World Heritage Site status in 1979. Cairo is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification according to GaWC.\nToday, Cairo has the oldest and largest cinema and music industry in the Arab world, as well as the world's second-oldest institution of higher learning, Al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organizations have regional headquarters in the city; the Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence.\nWith a population of over 10 million spread over , Cairo is by far the largest city in Egypt. An additional 9.5 million inhabitants live close to the city. Cairo, like many other megacities, suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic. The Cairo Metro, opened in 1987, is the oldest metro system in Africa, and ranks amongst the fifteen busiest in the world, with over 1 billion annual passenger rides. The economy of Cairo was ranked first in the Middle East in 2005, and 43rd globally on \"Foreign Policy\"'s 2010 Global Cities Index.\nEtymology.\nThe name Cairo is derived from the Arabic ' (), meaning 'the Vanquisher' or 'the Conqueror', given by the Fatimid Caliph al-Mu'izz following the establishment of the city as the capital of the Fatimid dynasty. Initially, its full name was ', meaning 'the Vanquisher of al-Mu'izz'. It is also supposedly due to the fact that the planet Mars, known in Arabic by names such as (, 'the Conquering Star'), was rising at the time of the city's founding. \nEgyptians often refer to Cairo as \"\" (]; ), the Egyptian Arabic name for Egypt itself, emphasizing the city's importance for the country.\nThere are a few Coptic names of the city. \"Tike\u0161r\u014dmi\" ( ]) is attested in the 1211 text \"The Martyrdom of John of Phanijoit\" and is either a calque meaning 'man breaker' (, 'the', , 'to break', and , 'man'), akin to Arabic \"\", or a derivation from Arabic (\"qa\u1e63r ar-r\u016bm\", \"the Roman castle\"), another name of Babylon Fortress in Old Cairo. The form Khairon () is attested in the modern Coptic text \u2ca0\u2c93\u2cab\u2c93\u2ca3\u2c93 \u2c9b\u0300\u2ca7\u2c89 \u03ef\u2c81\u2c85\u2c93\u2c81 \u2c99\u0300\u2c99\u2c8f\u2c93 \u2c82\u2c89\u2ca3\u2c8f\u2c9b\u2c81 (The Tale of Saint Verina). ( ]) or ( ]) is another name which is descended from the Greek name of Heliopolis (). Some argue that ( ]) or ( ]) is another Coptic name for Cairo, although others think that it is rather a name for the Abbasid province capital al-Askar. () is a popular modern rendering of an Arabic name (others being [Kairon] and [Kahira]) which is modern folk etymology meaning 'land of sun'. Some argue that it was a name of an Egyptian settlement upon which Cairo was built, but it is rather doubtful as this name is not attested in any Hieroglyphic or Demotic source, although some researchers, like Paul Casanova, view it as a legitimate theory. Cairo is also referred to as ( ]) or ( ]), which means Egypt in Coptic, the same way it is referred to in Egyptian Arabic.\nSometimes the city is informally referred to as \"\" by people from Alexandria (]; ).\nHistory.\nAncient settlements.\nThe area around present-day Cairo had long been a focal point of Ancient Egypt due to its strategic location at the junction of the Nile Valley and the Nile Delta regions (roughly Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt), which also placed it at the crossing of major routes between North Africa and the Levant. Memphis, the capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom and a major city up until the Ptolemaic period, was located a short distance south west of present-day Cairo. Heliopolis, another important city and major religious center, was located in what are now the modern districts of Matariya and Ain Shams in northeastern Cairo. It was largely destroyed by the Persian invasions in 525 BC and 343 BC and partly abandoned by the late first century BC.\nHowever, the origins of modern Cairo are generally traced back to a series of settlements in the first millennium AD. Around the turn of the fourth century, as Memphis was continuing to decline in importance, the Romans established a large fortress along the east bank of the Nile. The fortress, called Babylon, was built by the Roman emperor Diocletian (r. 285\u2013305) at the entrance of a canal connecting the Nile to the Red Sea that was created earlier by emperor Trajan (r. 98\u2013115). Further north of the fortress, near the present-day district of al-Azbakiya, was a port and fortified outpost known as Tendunyas () or Umm Dunayn. While no structures older than the 7th century have been preserved in the area aside from the Roman fortifications, historical evidence suggests that a sizeable city existed. The city was important enough that its bishop, Cyrus, participated in the Second Council of Ephesus in 449. \nThe Byzantine-Sassanian War between 602 and 628 caused great hardship and likely caused much of the urban population to leave for the countryside, leaving the settlement partly deserted. The site today remains at the nucleus of the Coptic Orthodox community, which separated from the Roman and Byzantine churches in the late 4th century. Cairo's oldest extant churches, such as the Church of Saint Barbara and the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (from the late 7th or early 8th century), are located inside the fortress walls in what is now known as Old Cairo or Coptic Cairo. \nFustat and other early Islamic settlements.\nThe Muslim conquest of Byzantine Egypt was led by Amr ibn al-As from 639 to 642. Babylon Fortress was besieged in September 640 and fell in April 641. In 641 or early 642, after the surrender of Alexandria (the Egyptian capital at the time), he founded a new settlement next to Babylon Fortress. The city, known as Fustat (), served as a garrison town and as the new administrative capital of Egypt. Historians such as Janet Abu-Lughod and Andr\u00e9 Raymond trace the genesis of present-day Cairo to the foundation of Fustat. The choice of founding a new settlement at this inland location, instead of using the existing capital of Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast, may have been due to the new conquerors' strategic priorities. One of the first projects of the new Muslim administration was to clear and re-open Trajan's ancient canal in order to ship grain more directly from Egypt to Medina, the capital of the caliphate in Arabia. Ibn al-As also founded a mosque for the city at the same time, now known as the Mosque of Amr Ibn al-As, the oldest mosque in Egypt and Africa (although the current structure dates from later expansions).\nIn 750, following the overthrow of the Umayyad caliphate by the Abbasids, the new rulers created their own settlement to the northeast of Fustat which became the new provincial capital. This was known as al-Askar () as it was laid out like a military camp. A governor's residence and a new mosque were also added, with the latter completed in 786. In 861, on the orders of the Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil, a Nilometer was built on Roda Island near Fustat. Although it was repaired and given a new roof in later centuries, its basic structure is still preserved today, making it the oldest preserved Islamic-era structure in Cairo today.\nIn 868 a commander of Turkic origin named Bakbak was sent to Egypt by the Abbasid caliph al-Mu'taz to restore order after a rebellion in the country. He was accompanied by his stepson, Ahmad ibn Tulun, who became effective governor of Egypt. Over time, Ibn Tulun gained an army and accumulated influence and wealth, allowing him to become the \"de facto\" independent ruler of both Egypt and Syria by 878. In 870, he used his growing wealth to found a new administrative capital, al-Qata'i (), to the northeast of Fustat and of al-Askar. The new city included a palace known as the \"Dar al-Imara\", a parade ground known as \"al-Maydan\", a bimaristan (hospital), and an aqueduct to supply water. Between 876 and 879 Ibn Tulun built a great mosque, now known as the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, at the center of the city, next to the palace. After his death in 884, Ibn Tulun was succeeded by his son and his descendants who continued a short-lived dynasty, the Tulunids. In 905, the Abbasids sent general Muhammad Sulayman al-Katib to re-assert direct control over the country. Tulunid rule was ended and al-Qatta'i was razed to the ground, except for the mosque which remains standing today.\nFoundation and expansion of Cairo.\nIn 969, the Shi'a Isma'ili Fatimid empire conquered Egypt after ruling from Ifriqiya. The Fatimid general Jawhar Al Saqili founded a new fortified city northeast of Fustat and of former al-Qata'i. It took four years to build the city, initially known as al-Man\u1e63\u016briyyah, which was to serve as the new capital of the caliphate. During that time, the construction of the al-Azhar Mosque was commissioned by order of the caliph, which developed into the third-oldest university in the world. Cairo would eventually become a centre of learning, with the library of Cairo containing hundreds of thousands of books. When Caliph al-Mu'izz li Din Allah arrived from the old Fatimid capital of Mahdia in Tunisia in 973, he gave the city its present name, \"Q\u0101hirat al-Mu'izz\" (\"The Vanquisher of al-Mu'izz\"), from which the name \"Cairo\" (\"al-Q\u0101hira\") originates. The caliphs lived in a vast and lavish palace complex that occupied the heart of the city. Cairo remained a relatively exclusive royal city for most of this era, but during the tenure of Badr al-Gamali as vizier (1073\u20131094) the restrictions were loosened for the first time and richer families from Fustat were allowed to move into the city. Between 1087 and 1092 Badr al-Gamali also rebuilt the city walls in stone and constructed the city gates of Bab al-Futuh, Bab al-Nasr, and Bab Zuweila that still stand today.\nDuring the Fatimid period Fustat reached its apogee in size and prosperity, acting as a center of craftsmanship and international trade and as the area's main port on the Nile. Historical sources report that multi-story communal residences existed in the city, particularly in its center, which were typically inhabited by middle and lower-class residents. Some of these were as high as seven stories and could house some 200 to 350 people. They may have been similar to Roman \"insulae\" and may have been the prototypes for the rental apartment complexes which became common in the later Mamluk and Ottoman periods.\nHowever, in 1168 the Fatimid vizier Shawar set fire to unfortified Fustat to prevent its potential capture by Amalric, the Crusader king of Jerusalem. While the fire did not destroy the city and it continued to exist afterward, it did mark the beginning of its decline. Over the following centuries it was Cairo, the former palace-city, that became the new economic center and attracted migration from Fustat.\nWhile the Crusaders did not capture the city in 1168, a continuing power struggle between Shawar, King Amalric, and the Zengid general Shirkuh led to the downfall of the Fatimid establishment. In 1169, Shirkuh's nephew Saladin was appointed as the new vizier of Egypt by the Fatimids and two years later he seized power from the family of the last Fatimid caliph, al-'\u0100\u1e0did. As the first Sultan of Egypt, Saladin established the Ayyubid dynasty, based in Cairo, and aligned Egypt with the Sunni Abbasids, who were based in Baghdad. In 1176, Saladin began construction on the Cairo Citadel, which was to serve as the seat of the Egyptian government until the mid-19th century. The construction of the Citadel definitively ended Fatimid-built Cairo's status as an exclusive palace-city and opened it up to common Egyptians and to foreign merchants, spurring its commercial development. Along with the Citadel, Saladin also began the construction of a new 20-kilometre-long wall that would protect both Cairo and Fustat on their eastern side and connect them with the new Citadel. These construction projects continued beyond Saladin's lifetime and were completed under his Ayyubid successors.\nApogee and decline under the Mamluks.\nIn 1250, during the Seventh Crusade, the Ayyubid dynasty had a crisis with the death of al-Salih and power transitioned instead to the Mamluks, partly with the help of al-Salih's wife, Shajar ad-Durr, who ruled for a brief period around this time. Mamluks were soldiers who were purchased as young slaves and raised to serve in the sultan's army. Between 1250 and 1517 the throne of the Mamluk Sultanate passed from one mamluk to another in a system of succession that was generally non-hereditary, but also frequently violent and chaotic. The Mamluk Empire nonetheless became a major power in the region and was responsible for repelling the advance of the Mongols (most famously at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260) and for eliminating the last Crusader states in the Levant.\nDespite their military character, the Mamluks were also prolific builders and left a rich architectural legacy throughout Cairo. Continuing a practice started by the Ayyubids, much of the land occupied by former Fatimid palaces was sold and replaced by newer buildings, becoming a prestigious site for the construction of Mamluk religious and funerary complexes. Construction projects initiated by the Mamluks pushed the city outward while also bringing new infrastructure to the centre of the city. Meanwhile, Cairo flourished as a centre of Islamic scholarship and a crossroads on the spice trade route among the civilisations in Afro-Eurasia. Under the reign of the Mamluk sultan al-Nasir Muhammad (1293\u20131341, with interregnums), Cairo reached its apogee in terms of population and wealth. By 1340, Cairo had a population of close to half a million, making it the largest city west of China.\nMulti-story buildings occupied by rental apartments, known as a \"rab'\" (plural \"rib\u0101\"' or \"urbu\"), became common in the Mamluk period and continued to be a feature of the city's housing during the later Ottoman period. These apartments were often laid out as multi-story duplexes or triplexes. They were sometimes attached to caravanserais, where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were rented out to tenants. The oldest partially-preserved example of this type of structure is the Wikala of Amir Qawsun, built before 1341. Residential buildings were in turn organized into close-knit neighbourhoods called a \"harat\", which in many cases had gates that could be closed off at night or during disturbances.\nWhen the traveller Ibn Battuta first came to Cairo in 1326, he described it as the principal district of Egypt. When he passed through the area again on his return journey in 1348 the Black Death was ravaging most major cities. He cited reports of thousands of deaths per day in Cairo. Although Cairo avoided Europe's stagnation during the Late Middle Ages, it could not escape the Black Death, which struck the city more than fifty times between 1348 and 1517. During its initial, and most deadly waves, approximately 200,000 people were killed by the plague, and, by the 15th century, Cairo's population had been reduced to between 150,000 and 300,000. The population decline was accompanied by a period of political instability between 1348 and 1412. It was nonetheless in this period that the largest Mamluk-era religious monument, the Madrasa-Mosque of Sultan Hasan, was built. In the late 14th century the Burji Mamluks replaced the Bahri Mamluks as rulers of the Mamluk state, but the Mamluk system continued to decline.\nThough the plagues returned frequently throughout the 15th century, Cairo remained a major metropolis and its population recovered in part through rural migration. More conscious efforts were conducted by rulers and city officials to redress the city's infrastructure and cleanliness. Its economy and politics also became more deeply connected with the wider Mediterranean. Some Mamluk sultans in this period, such as Barbsay (r. 1422\u20131438) and Qaytbay (r. 1468\u20131496), had relatively long and successful reigns. After al-Nasir Muhammad, Qaytbay was one of the most prolific patrons of art and architecture of the Mamluk era. He built or restored numerous monuments in Cairo, in addition to commissioning projects beyond Egypt. The crisis of Mamluk power and of Cairo's economic role deepened after Qaytbay. The city's status was diminished after Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around the Cape of Good Hope between 1497 and 1499, thereby allowing spice traders to avoid Cairo.\nOttoman rule.\nCairo's political influence diminished significantly after the Ottomans defeated Sultan al-Ghuri in the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516 and conquered Egypt in 1517. Ruling from Constantinople, Sultan Selim I relegated Egypt to a province, with Cairo as its capital. For this reason, the history of Cairo during Ottoman times is often described as inconsequential, especially in comparison to other time periods. \nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, Cairo still remained an important economic and cultural centre. Although no longer on the spice route, the city facilitated the transportation of Yemeni coffee and Indian textiles, primarily to Anatolia, North Africa, and the Balkans. Cairene merchants were instrumental in bringing goods to the barren Hejaz, especially during the annual hajj to Mecca. It was during this same period that al-Azhar University reached the predominance among Islamic schools that it continues to hold today; pilgrims on their way to hajj often attested to the superiority of the institution, which had become associated with Egypt's body of Islamic scholars. The first printing press of the Middle East, printing in Hebrew, was established in Cairo c.\u20091557 by a scion of the Soncino family of printers, Italian Jews of Ashkenazi origin who operated a press in Constantinople. The existence of the press is known solely from two fragments discovered in the Cairo Geniza. \nUnder the Ottomans, Cairo expanded south and west from its nucleus around the Citadel. The city was the second-largest in the empire, behind Constantinople, and, although migration was not the primary source of Cairo's growth, twenty percent of its population at the end of the 18th century consisted of religious minorities and foreigners from around the Mediterranean. Still, when Napoleon arrived in Cairo in 1798, the city's population was less than 300,000, forty percent lower than it was at the height of Mamluk\u2014and Cairene\u2014influence in the mid-14th century.\nThe French occupation was short-lived as British and Ottoman forces, including a sizeable Albanian contingent, recaptured the country in 1801. Cairo itself was besieged by a British and Ottoman force culminating with the French surrender on 22 June 1801. The British vacated Egypt two years later, leaving the Ottomans, the Albanians, and the long-weakened Mamluks jostling for control of the country. Continued civil war allowed an Albanian named Muhammad Ali Pasha to ascend to the role of commander and eventually, with the approval of the religious establishment, viceroy of Egypt in 1805.\nModern era.\nUntil his death in 1848, Muhammad Ali Pasha instituted a number of social and economic reforms that earned him the title of founder of modern Egypt. However, while Muhammad Ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city, those reforms had minimal effect on Cairo's landscape. Bigger changes came to Cairo under Isma'il Pasha (r. 1863\u20131879), who continued the modernisation processes started by his grandfather. Drawing inspiration from Paris, Isma'il envisioned a city of maidans and wide avenues; due to financial constraints, only some of them, in the area now composing Downtown Cairo, came to fruition. Isma'il also sought to modernize the city, which was merging with neighbouring settlements, by establishing a public works ministry, bringing gas and lighting to the city, and opening a theatre and opera house.\nThe immense debt resulting from Isma'il's projects provided a pretext for increasing European control, which culminated with the British invasion in 1882. The city's economic centre quickly moved west toward the Nile, away from the historic Islamic Cairo section and toward the contemporary, European-style areas built by Isma'il. Europeans accounted for five percent of Cairo's population at the end of the 19th century, by which point they held most top governmental positions.\nIn 1906 the Heliopolis Oasis Company headed by the Belgian industrialist \u00c9douard Empain and his Egyptian counterpart Boghos Nubar, built a suburb called Heliopolis (city of the sun in Greek) ten kilometers from the center of Cairo. In 1905\u20131907 the northern part of the Gezira island was developed by the Baehler Company into Zamalek, which would later become Cairo's upscale \"chic\" neighbourhood. In 1906 construction began on Garden City, a neighbourhood of urban villas with gardens and curved streets.\nThe British occupation was intended to be temporary, but it lasted well into the 20th century. Nationalists staged large-scale demonstrations in Cairo in 1919, five years after Egypt had been declared a British protectorate. Nevertheless, this led to Egypt's independence in 1922.\n1924 Cairo Quran.\nThe King Fuad I Edition of the Qur'an was first published on 10 July 1924 in Cairo under the patronage of King Fuad. The goal of the government of the newly formed Kingdom of Egypt was not to delegitimize the other variant Quranic texts (\"qira'at\"), but to eliminate errors found in Qur'anic texts used in state schools. A committee of teachers chose to preserve a single one of the canonical qira'at \"readings\", namely that of the \"\u1e24af\u1e63\" version, an 8th-century Kufic recitation. This edition has become the standard for modern printings of the Quran for much of the Islamic world. The publication has been called a \"terrific success\", and the edition has been described as one \"now widely seen as the official text of the Qur'an\", so popular among both Sunni and Shi'a that the common belief among less well-informed Muslims is \"that the Qur'an has a single, unambiguous reading\". Minor amendments were made later in 1924 and in 1936 - the \"Faruq edition\" in honour of then ruler, King Faruq.\nBritish occupation until 1956.\nBritish troops remained in the country until 1956. During this time, urban Cairo, spurred by new bridges and transport links, continued to expand to include the upscale neighbourhoods of Garden City, Zamalek, and Heliopolis. Between 1882 and 1937, the population of Cairo more than tripled\u2014from 347,000 to 1.3 million\u2014and its area increased from .\nThe city was devastated during the 1952 riots known as the Cairo Fire or Black Saturday, which saw the destruction of nearly 700 shops, movie theatres, casinos and hotels in downtown Cairo. The British departed Cairo following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, but the city's rapid growth showed no signs of abating. Seeking to accommodate the increasing population, President Gamal Abdel Nasser redeveloped Tahrir Square and the Nile Corniche, and improved the city's network of bridges and highways. Meanwhile, additional controls of the Nile fostered development within Gezira Island and along the city's waterfront. The metropolis began to encroach on the fertile Nile Delta, prompting the government to build desert satellite towns and devise incentives for city-dwellers to move to them.\nAfter 1956.\nIn the second half of the 20th century Cairo continue to grow enormously in both population and area. Between 1947 and 2006 the population of Greater Cairo went from 2,986,280 to 16,292,269. The population explosion also drove the rise of \"informal\" housing (\"'ashwa'iyyat\"), meaning housing that was built without any official planning or control. The exact form of this type of housing varies considerably but usually has a much higher population density than formal housing. By 2009, over 63% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in informal neighbourhoods, even though these occupied only 17% of the total area of Greater Cairo. According to economist David Sims, informal housing has the benefits of providing affordable accommodation and vibrant communities to huge numbers of Cairo's working classes, but it also suffers from government neglect, a relative lack of services, and overcrowding. \nThe \"formal\" city was also expanded. The most notable example was the creation of Madinat Nasr, a huge government-sponsored expansion of the city to the east which officially began in 1959 but was primarily developed in the mid-1970s. Starting in 1977 the Egyptian government established the New Urban Communities Authority to initiate and direct the development of new planned cities on the outskirts of Cairo, generally established on desert land. These new satellite cities were intended to provide housing, investment, and employment opportunities for the region's growing population as well as to pre-empt the further growth of informal neighbourhoods. As of 2014, about 10% of the population of Greater Cairo lived in the new cities.\nConcurrently, Cairo established itself as a political and economic hub for North Africa and the Arab world, with many multinational businesses and organisations, including the Arab League, operating out of the city. In 1979 the historic districts of Cairo were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nIn 1992, Cairo was hit by an earthquake causing 545 deaths, injuring 6,512 and leaving around 50,000 people homeless.\n2011 Egyptian revolution.\nCairo's Tahrir Square was the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution against former president Hosni Mubarak. Over 2 million protesters were at Cairo's Tahrir square. More than 50,000 protesters first occupied the square on 25 January, during which the area's wireless services were reported to be impaired. In the following days Tahrir Square continued to be the primary destination for protests in Cairo as it took place following a popular uprising that began on Tuesday, 25 January 2011 and continued until June 2013. The uprising was mainly a campaign of non-violent civil resistance, which featured a series of demonstrations, marches, acts of civil disobedience, and labour strikes. Millions of protesters from a variety of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Despite being predominantly peaceful in nature, the revolution was not without violent clashes between security forces and protesters, with at least 846 people killed and 6,000 injured. The uprising took place in Cairo, Alexandria, and in other cities in Egypt, following the Tunisian revolution that resulted in the overthrow of the long-time Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. On 11 February, following weeks of determined popular protest and pressure, Hosni Mubarak resigned from office.\nPost-revolutionary Cairo.\nUnder the rule of President el-Sisi, in March 2015 plans were announced for another yet-unnamed planned city to be built further east of the existing satellite city of New Cairo, intended to serve as the new capital of Egypt.\nGeography.\nCairo is located in northern Egypt, known as Lower Egypt, south of the Mediterranean Sea and west of the Gulf of Suez and Suez Canal. The city lies along the Nile River, immediately south of the point where the river leaves its desert-bound valley and branches into the low-lying Nile Delta region. Although the Cairo metropolis extends away from the Nile in all directions, the city of Cairo resides only on the east bank of the river and two islands within it on a total area of . Geologically, Cairo lies on alluvium and sand dunes which date from the quaternary period.\nUntil the mid-19th century, when the river was tamed by dams, levees, and other controls, the Nile in the vicinity of Cairo was highly susceptible to changes in course and surface level. Over the years, the Nile gradually shifted westward, providing the site between the eastern edge of the river and the Mokattam highlands on which the city now stands. The land on which Cairo was established in 969 (present-day Islamic Cairo) was located underwater just over three hundred years earlier, when Fustat was first built.\nLow periods of the Nile during the 11th century continued to add to the landscape of Cairo; a new island, known as \"Geziret al-Fil\", first appeared in 1174, but eventually became connected to the mainland. Today, the site of \"Geziret al-Fil\" is occupied by the Shubra district. The low periods created another island at the turn of the 14th century that now composes Zamalek and Gezira. Land reclamation efforts by the Mamluks and Ottomans further contributed to expansion on the east bank of the river.\nBecause of the Nile's movement, the newer parts of the city\u2014Garden City, Downtown Cairo, and Zamalek\u2014are located closest to the riverbank. The areas, which are home to most of Cairo's embassies, are surrounded on the north, east, and south by the older parts of the city. Old Cairo, located south of the centre, holds the remnants of Fustat and the heart of Egypt's Coptic Christian community, Coptic Cairo. The Boulaq district, which lies in the northern part of the city, was born out of a major 16th-century port and is now a major industrial centre. The Citadel is located east of the city centre around Islamic Cairo, which dates back to the Fatimid era and the foundation of Cairo. While western Cairo is dominated by wide boulevards, open spaces, and modern architecture of European influence, the eastern half, having grown haphazardly over the centuries, is dominated by small lanes, crowded tenements, and Islamic architecture.\nNorthern and extreme eastern parts of Cairo, which include satellite towns, are among the most recent additions to the city, as they developed in the late-20th and early-21st centuries to accommodate the city's rapid growth. The western bank of the Nile is commonly included within the urban area of Cairo, but it composes the city of Giza and the Giza Governorate. Giza city has also undergone significant expansion over recent years, and today has a population of 2.7 million. The Cairo Governorate was just north of the Helwan Governorate from 2008 when some Cairo's southern districts, including Maadi and New Cairo, were split off and annexed into the new governorate, to 2011 when the Helwan Governorate was reincorporated into the Cairo Governorate.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the level of air pollution in Cairo is nearly 12 times higher than the recommended safety level.\nClimate.\nIn Cairo, and along the Nile River Valley, the climate is a hot desert climate (\"BWh\" according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system). Wind storms can be frequent, bringing Saharan dust into the city, from March to May and the air often becomes uncomfortably dry. High temperatures in winter range from , while night-time lows drop to below , often to . In summer, the highs rarely surpass , and lows drop to about . Rainfall is sparse and only happens in the colder months, but sudden showers can cause severe flooding. The summer months have high humidity due to its coastal location. Snowfall is extremely rare; a small amount of graupel, widely believed to be snow, fell on Cairo's easternmost suburbs on 13 December 2013, the first time Cairo's area received this kind of precipitation in many decades. Dew points in the hottest months range from in June to in August.\nMetropolitan area and districts.\nThe city of Cairo forms part of Greater Cairo, the largest metropolitan area in Africa. While it has no administrative body, the Ministry of Planning considers it as an economic region consisting of Cairo Governorate, Giza Governorate, and Qalyubia Governorate. As a contiguous metropolitan area, various studies have considered Greater Cairo be composed of the administrative cities that are Cairo, Giza and Shubra al-Kheima, in addition to the satellite cities/new towns surrounding them.\nCairo is a city-state where the governor is also the head of the city. Cairo City itself differs from other Egyptian cities in that it has an extra administrative division between the city and district levels, and that is areas, which are headed by deputy governors. Cairo consists of 4 areas \"(manatiq, singl. mantiqa)\" divided into 38 districts \"(ahya', singl. hayy)\" and 46 qisms (police wards, 1-2 per district):\nThe Northern Area is divided into 8 Districts:\nThe Eastern Area divided into 9 Districts and three new cities:\nThe Western Area divided into 9 Districts:\nThe Southern Area divided into 12 Districts:\nSatellite cities.\nSince 1977 a number of new towns have been planned and built by the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) in the Eastern Desert around Cairo, ostensibly to accommodate additional population growth and development of the city and stem the development of self-built informal areas, especially over agricultural land. As of 2022 four new towns have been built and have residential populations: 15th of May City, Badr City, Shorouk City, and New Cairo. In addition, two more are under construction: the New Administrative Capital. And Capital Gardens, where land was allocated in 2021, and which will house most of the civil servants employed in the new capital.\nPlanned new capital.\nIn March 2015, plans were announced for a new city to be built east of Cairo, in an undeveloped area of the Cairo Governorate, which would serve as the New Administrative Capital of Egypt.\nDemographics.\nAccording to the 2017 census, Cairo had a population of 9,539,673 people, distributed across 46 qisms (police wards): \nReligion.\nThe majority of Egypt and Cairo's population is Sunni Muslim. A significant Christian minority exists, among whom Coptic Orthodox are the majority. Precise numbers for each religious community in Egypt are not available and estimates vary. Other churches that have, or had, a presence in modern Cairo include the Catholic Church (including Armenian Catholic, Coptic Catholic, Chaldean Catholic, Syrian Catholic, and Maronite), the Greek Orthodox Church, the Evangelical Church of Egypt (Synod of the Nile), and some Protestant churches. Until the 20th century, Cairo had a sizeable Jewish community, but as of 2022 only 3 Jews were reported to be living in the city. A total of 12 synagogues in Cairo still exist.\nEconomy.\nCairo's economy has traditionally been based on governmental institutions and services, with the modern productive sector expanding in the 20th century to include developments in textiles and food processing \u2013 specifically the production of sugar cane. As of 2005, Egypt has the largest non-oil based GDP in the Arab world. \nCairo accounts for 11% of Egypt's population and 22% of its economy (PPP). The majority of the nation's commerce is generated there, or passes through the city. The great majority of publishing houses and media outlets and nearly all film studios are there, as are half of the nation's hospital beds and universities. This has fuelled rapid construction in the city, with one building in five being less than 15 years old.\nThis growth until recently surged well ahead of city services. Homes, roads, electricity, telephone and sewer services were all in short supply. Analysts trying to grasp the magnitude of the change coined terms like \"hyper-urbanization\".\nInfrastructure.\nHealth.\nCairo, as well as neighbouring Giza, has been established as Egypt's main centre for medical treatment, and despite some exceptions, has the most advanced level of medical care in the country. Cairo's hospitals include the JCI-accredited As-Salaam International Hospital\u2014Corniche El Nile, Maadi (Egypt's largest private hospital with 350 beds), Ain Shams University Hospital, Dar Al Fouad, Nile Badrawi Hospital, 57357 Hospital, as well as Qasr El Eyni Hospital.\nEducation.\nGreater Cairo has long been the hub of education and educational services for Egypt and the region.\nToday, Greater Cairo is the centre for many government offices governing the Egyptian educational system, has the largest number of educational schools, and higher education institutes among other cities and governorates of Egypt.\nSome of the International Schools found in Cairo:\nUniversities in Greater Cairo:\nTransport.\nCairo has an extensive road network, rail system, subway system and maritime services. Road transport is facilitated by personal vehicles, taxi cabs, privately owned public buses and microbuses. Cairo International Airport is the country's largest airport and one of the busiest airports in Africa.\nPublic transportation.\nCairo, specifically Ramses Station, is the centre of almost the entire Egyptian transportation network.\nThe Cairo Transportation Authority (CTA) manages Cairo's public transit. The subway system, the Cairo Metro, is a fast and efficient way of getting around Cairo. The metro network covers Helwan and other suburbs. It can get very crowded during rush hour. Two train cars (the fourth and fifth ones) are reserved for women only, although women may ride in any car they want.\nTrams in Greater Cairo and Cairo trolleybus were used as modes of transportation, but were closed in the 1970s everywhere except Heliopolis and Helwan. These were shut down in 2014, after the Egyptian Revolution.\nIn 2017, plans to construct two monorail systems were announced, one linking 6th of October to suburban Giza, a distance of , and the other linking Nasr City to New Cairo, a distance of .\nRoads.\nAn extensive road network connects Cairo with other Egyptian cities and villages. There is a new Ring Road that surrounds the outskirts of the city, with exits that reach outer Cairo districts. There are flyovers and bridges, such as the 6th October Bridge that, when the traffic is not heavy, allow fast means of transportation from one side of the city to the other.\nCairo traffic is known to be overwhelming and overcrowded. Traffic moves at a relatively fluid pace. Drivers tend to be aggressive, but are more courteous at junctions, taking turns going, with police aiding in traffic control of some congested areas.\nCulture.\nCairo Opera House.\nPresident Mubarak inaugurated the new Cairo Opera House of the Egyptian National Cultural Centres on 10 October 1988, 17 years after the Royal Opera House had been destroyed by fire. The National Cultural Centre was built with the help of JICA, the Japan International Co-operation Agency and stands as a prominent feature for the Japanese-Egyptian co-operation and the friendship between the two nations.\nKhedivial Opera House.\nThe Khedivial Opera House, or Royal Opera House, was the original opera house in Cairo. It was dedicated on 1 November 1869 and burned down on 28 October 1971. After the original opera house was destroyed, Cairo was without an opera house for nearly two decades until the opening of the new Cairo Opera House in 1988.\nCairo International Film Festival.\nCairo held its first international film festival 16 August 1976, when the first Cairo International Film Festival was launched by the Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics, headed by Kamal El-Mallakh. The Association ran the festival for seven years until 1983.\nThis achievement lead to the President of the Festival again contacting the FIAPF with the request that a competition should be included at the 1991 Festival. The request was granted.\nIn 1998, the Festival took place under the presidency of one of Egypt's leading actors, Hussein Fahmy, who was appointed by the Minister of Culture, Farouk Hosni, after the death of Saad El-Din Wahba. Four years later, the journalist and writer Cherif El-Shoubashy became president.\nCairo Geniza.\nThe Cairo Geniza is an accumulation of almost 200,000 Jewish manuscripts that were found in the \"genizah\" of the Ben Ezra synagogue (built 882) of Fustat, Egypt (now Old Cairo), the Basatin cemetery east of Old Cairo, and a number of old documents that were bought in Cairo in the later 19th century. These documents were written from about 870 to 1880 AD and have been archived in various American and European libraries. The Taylor-Schechter collection in the University of Cambridge runs to 140,000 manuscripts; a further 40,000 manuscripts are housed at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.\nFood.\nThe majority of Cairenes make food for themselves and make use of local produce markets. The restaurant scene includes Arab cuisine and Middle Eastern cuisine, including local staples such as \"koshary\". The city's most exclusive restaurants are typically concentrated in Zamalek and around the luxury hotels lining the shore of the Nile near the Garden City district. Influence from modern western society is also evident, with American chains such as McDonald's, Arby's, Pizza Hut, Subway, and Kentucky Fried Chicken being easy to find in central areas.\nSports.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Egypt, and Cairo has a number of sporting teams that compete in national and regional leagues, most notably Al Ahly and Zamalek SC, who are the CAF first and second African clubs of the 20th century. The annual match between Al Ahly and El Zamalek is one of the most watched sports events in Egypt as well as the African-Arab region. The teams form the major rivalry of Egyptian football and are the first and the second champions in Africa and the Arab world. They play their home games at Cairo International Stadium or Naser Stadium, which is the second largest stadium in Egypt, as well as the largest in Cairo and one of the largest stadiums in the world.\nThe Cairo International Stadium was built in 1960 and its multi-purpose sports complex that houses the main football stadium, an indoor stadium, several satellite fields that held several regional, continental, and global games, including the African Games, U17 Football World Championship and were one of the stadiums scheduled that hosted the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations which was played in January 2006. Egypt later won the competition and went on to win the next edition in Ghana (2008) making the Egyptian and Ghanaian national teams the only teams to win the African Nations Cup Back to back which resulted in Egypt winning the title for a record number of six times in the history of African Continental Competition. This was followed by a third consecutive win in Angola in 2010, making Egypt the only country with a record 3-consecutive and 7-total Continental Football Competition winner. This achievement also placed the Egyptian football team as the #9 best team in the world's FIFA rankings. As of 2021, Egypt's national team is ranked #46 in the world by FIFA.\nCairo failed at the applicant stage when bidding for the 2008 Summer Olympics, which was hosted in Beijing, China. However, Cairo did host the 2007 Pan Arab Games.\nThere are several other sports teams in the city that participate in several sports including Gezira Sporting Club, el Shams Club, el Seid Club, Heliopolis Sporting Club, and several smaller clubs, but the biggest clubs in Egypt (not in the area but in sports) are Al Ahly and Zamalek. They have the two biggest football teams in Egypt. There are new sports clubs in the area of New Cairo (one hour far from Cairo's downtown), these are Al Zohour sporting club, Wadi Degla sporting club and Platinum Club.\nMost of the sports federations of the country are also located in the city suburbs, including the Egyptian Football Association. The headquarters of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) was previously located in Cairo, before relocating to its new headquarters in 6 October City, a small city away from Cairo's crowded districts.\nIn October 2008, the Egyptian Rugby Federation was officially formed and granted membership into the International Rugby Board.\nEgypt is internationally known for the excellence of its squash players who excel in professional and junior divisions. Egypt has seven players in the top ten of the PSA men's world rankings, and three in the women's top ten. Mohamed El Shorbagy held the world number one position for more than a year before being overtaken by compatriot Karim Abdel Gawad, who is number two behind Gregory Gaultier of France. Ramy Ashour and Amr Shabana are regarded as two of the most talented squash players in history. Shabana won the World Open title four times and Ashour twice, although his recent form has been hampered by injury. Egypt's Nour El Sherbini has won the Women's World Championship twice and has been women's world number one for 16 consecutive months. On 30 April 2016, she became the youngest woman to win the Women's World Championship which was held in Malaysia. In April 2017 she retained her title by winning the Women's World Championship which was held in the Egyptian resort of El Gouna.\nCairo is the official end point of Cross Egypt Challenge where its route ends yearly in the most sacred place in Egypt, under the Great Pyramids of Giza with a huge trophy-giving ceremony.\nCityscape and landmarks.\nTahrir Square.\nTahrir Square was founded during the mid 19th century with the establishment of modern downtown Cairo. It was first named Ismailia Square, after the 19th-century ruler Khedive Ismail, who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the Nile' design. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1919 the square became widely known as Tahrir (Liberation) Square, though it was not officially renamed as such until after the 1952 Revolution which eliminated the monarchy. Several notable buildings surround the square including, the American University in Cairo's downtown campus, the Mogamma governmental administrative Building, the headquarters of the Arab League, the Nile Ritz Carlton Hotel, and the Egyptian Museum. Being at the heart of Cairo, the square witnessed several major protests over the years. However, the most notable event in the square was being the focal point of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution against former president Hosni Mubarak. In 2020 the government completed the erection of a new monument in the center of the square featuring an ancient obelisk from the reign of Ramses II, originally unearthed at Tanis (San al-Hagar) in 2019, and four ram-headed sphinx statues moved from Karnak.\nEgyptian Museum.\nThe Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, known commonly as the Egyptian Museum, is home to the most extensive collection of ancient Egyptian antiquities in the world. It has 136,000 items on display, with many more hundreds of thousands in its basement storerooms. Among the collections on display are the finds from the tomb of Tutankhamun.\nGrand Egyptian Museum.\nMuch of the collection of the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, including the Tutankhamun collection, are slated to be moved to the new Grand Egyptian Museum, under construction in Giza and was due to open by the end of 2020.\nCairo Tower.\nThe Cairo Tower is a free-standing tower with a revolving restaurant at the top. It provides a bird's eye view of Cairo to the restaurant patrons. It stands in the Zamalek district on Gezira Island in the Nile River, in the city centre. At , it is higher than the Great Pyramid of Giza, which stands some to the southwest.\nOld Cairo.\nThis area of Cairo is so-named as it contains the remains of the ancient Roman fortress of Babylon and also overlaps the original site of Fustat, the first Arab settlement in Egypt (7th century AD) and the predecessor of later Cairo. The area includes Coptic Cairo, which holds a high concentration of old Christian churches such as the Hanging Church, the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, and other Christian or Coptic buildings, most of which are located in an enclave on the site of the ancient Roman fortress. It is also the location of the Coptic Museum, which showcases the history of Coptic art from Greco-Roman to Islamic times, and of the Ben Ezra Synagogue, the oldest and best-known synagogue in Cairo, where the important collection of Geniza documents were discovered in the 19th century.\nTo the north of this Coptic enclave is the Amr ibn al-'As Mosque, the first mosque in Egypt and the most important religious centre of what was formerly Fustat, founded in 642 AD right after the Arab conquest but rebuilt many times since. A part of the former city of Fustat has also been excavated to the east of the mosque and of the Coptic enclave, although the archeological site is threatened by encroaching construction and modern development. To the northwest of Babylon Fortress and the mosque is the Monastery of Saint Mercurius (or \"Dayr Abu Sayfayn\"), an important and historic Coptic religious complex consisting of the Church of Saint Mercurius, the Church of Saint Shenute, and the Church of the Virgin (also known as \"al-Damshiriya\"). Several other historic churches are also situated to the south of Babylon Fortress.\nIslamic Cairo.\nCairo holds one of the greatest concentrations of historical monuments of Islamic architecture in the world. The areas around the old walled city and around the Citadel are characterized by hundreds of mosques, tombs, madrasas, mansions, caravanserais, and fortifications dating from the Islamic era and are often referred to as \"Islamic Cairo\", especially in English travel literature. It is also the location of several important religious shrines such as the al-Hussein Mosque (whose shrine is believed to hold the head of Husayn ibn Ali), the Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafi'i (founder of the Shafi'i \"madhhab\", one of the primary schools of thought in Sunni Islamic jurisprudence), the Tomb of Sayyida Ruqayya, the Mosque of Sayyida Nafisa, and others.\nThe first mosque in Egypt was the Mosque of Amr ibn al-As in what was formerly Fustat, the first Arab-Muslim settlement in the area. However, the Mosque of Ibn Tulun is the oldest mosque that still retains its original form and is a rare example of Abbasid architecture from the classical period of Islamic civilization. It was built in 876\u2013879 AD in a style inspired by the Abbasid capital of Samarra in Iraq. It is one of the largest mosques in Cairo and is often cited as one of the most beautiful. Another Abbasid construction, the Nilometer on Roda Island, is the oldest original structure in Cairo, built in 862 AD. It was designed to measure the level of the Nile, which was important for agricultural and administrative purposes.\nThe settlement that was formally named Cairo (Arabic: \"al-Qahira\") was founded to the northeast of Fustat in 959 AD by the victorious Fatimid army. The Fatimids built it as a separate palatial city which contained their palaces and institutions of government. It was enclosed by a circuit of walls, which were rebuilt in stone in the late 11th century AD by the vizier Badr al-Gamali, parts of which survive today at Bab Zuwayla in the south and Bab al-Futuh and Bab al-Nasr in the north. Among the extant monuments from the Fatimid era are the large Mosque of al-Hakim, the Aqmar Mosque, Juyushi Mosque, Lulua Mosque, and the Mosque of Al-Salih Tala'i.\nOne of the most important and lasting institutions founded in the Fatimid period was the Mosque of al-Azhar, founded in 970 AD, which competes with the Qarawiyyin in Fes for the title of oldest university in the world. Today, al-Azhar University is the foremost Center of Islamic learning in the world and one of Egypt's largest universities with campuses across the country. The mosque itself retains significant Fatimid elements but has been added to and expanded in subsequent centuries, notably by the Mamluk sultans Qaytbay and al-Ghuri and by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda in the 18th century. \nThe most prominent architectural heritage of medieval Cairo, however, dates from the Mamluk period, from 1250 to 1517 AD. The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, madrasa, khanqah (for Sufis), a sabil (water dispensary), and a mausoleum for themselves and their families. Among the best-known examples of Mamluk monuments in Cairo are the huge Mosque-Madrasa of Sultan Hasan, the Mosque of Amir al-Maridani, the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad (whose twin minarets were built above the gate of Bab Zuwayla), the Sultan Al-Ghuri complex, the funerary complex of Sultan Qaytbay in the Northern Cemetery, and the trio of monuments in the Bayn al-Qasrayn area comprising the complex of Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun, the Madrasa of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the Madrasa of Sultan Barquq. Some mosques include spolia (often columns or capitals) from earlier buildings built by the Romans, Byzantines, or Copts.\nThe Mamluks, and the later Ottomans, also built \"wikala\"s or caravanserais to house merchants and goods due to the important role of trade and commerce in Cairo's economy. Still intact today is the Wikala al-Ghuri, which today hosts regular performances by the Al-Tannoura Egyptian Heritage Dance Troupe. The Khan al-Khalili is a commercial hub which also integrated caravanserais (also known as \"khan\"s).\nCitadel of Cairo.\nThe Citadel is a fortified enclosure begun by Salah al-Din in 1176 AD on an outcrop of the Muqattam Hills as part of a large defensive system to protect both Cairo to the north and Fustat to the southwest. It was the centre of Egyptian government and residence of its rulers until 1874, when Khedive Isma'il moved to 'Abdin Palace. It is still occupied by the military today, but is now open as a tourist attraction comprising, notably, the National Military Museum, the 14th century Mosque of al-Nasir Muhammad, and the 19th century Mosque of Muhammad Ali which commands a dominant position on Cairo's skyline.\nKhan el-Khalili.\nKhan el-Khalili is an ancient bazaar, or marketplace adjacent to the Al-Hussein Mosque. It dates back to 1385, when Amir Jarkas el-Khalili built a large caravanserai, or khan. (A caravanserai is a hotel for traders, and usually the focal point for any surrounding area.) This original caravanserai building was demolished by Sultan al-Ghuri, who rebuilt it as a new commercial complex in the early 16th century, forming the basis for the network of souqs existing today. Many medieval elements remain today, including the ornate Mamluk-style gateways. Today, the Khan el-Khalili is a major tourist attraction and popular stop for tour groups.\nSociety.\nIn the present day, Cairo is heavily urbanized and most Cairenes live in apartment buildings. Because of the influx of people into the city, lone standing houses are rare, and apartment buildings accommodate for the limited space and abundance of people. Single detached houses are usually owned by the wealthy. Formal education is also seen as important, with twelve years of standard formal education. Cairenes can take a standardized test similar to the SAT to be accepted to an institution of higher learning, but most children do not finish school and opt to pick up a trade to enter the work force. Egypt still struggles with poverty, with almost half the population living on $2 or less a day.\nWomen's rights.\nThe civil rights movement for women in Cairo \u2013 and by extent, Egypt \u2013 has been a struggle for years. Women are reported to face constant discrimination, sexual harassment, and abuse throughout Cairo. A 2013 UN study found that over 99% of Egyptian women reported experiencing sexual harassment at some point in their lives. The problem has persisted in spite of new national laws since 2014 defining and criminalizing sexual harassment. The situation is so severe that in 2017, Cairo was named by one poll as the most dangerous megacity for women in the world. In 2020, the social media account \"Assault Police\" began to name and shame perpetrators of violence against women, in an effort to dissuade potential offenders. The account was founded by student Nadeen Ashraf, who is credited for instigating an iteration of the #MeToo movement in Egypt.\nPollution.\nThe air pollution in Cairo is a matter of serious concern. Greater Cairo's volatile aromatic hydrocarbon levels are higher than many other similar cities. Air quality measurements in Cairo have also been recording dangerous levels of lead, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and suspended particulate matter concentrations due to decades of unregulated vehicle emissions, urban industrial operations, and chaff and trash burning. There are over 4,500,000 cars on the streets of Cairo, 60% of which are over 10 years old, and therefore lack modern emission cutting features. Cairo has a very poor dispersion factor because of its lack of rain and its layout of tall buildings and narrow streets, which create a bowl effect.\nIn recent years, a black cloud (as Egyptians refer to it) of smog has appeared over Cairo every autumn due to temperature inversion. Smog causes serious respiratory diseases and eye irritations for the city's citizens. Tourists who are not familiar with such high levels of pollution must take extra care.\nCairo also has many unregistered lead and copper smelters which heavily pollute the city. The results of this has been a permanent haze over the city with particulate matter in the air reaching over three times normal levels. It is estimated that 10,000 to 25,000 people a year in Cairo die due to air pollution-related diseases. Lead has been shown to cause harm to the central nervous system and neurotoxicity particularly in children. In 1995, the first environmental acts were introduced and the situation has seen some improvement with 36 air monitoring stations and emissions tests on cars. Twenty thousand buses have also been commissioned to the city to improve congestion levels, which are very high.\nThe city also suffers from a high level of land pollution. Cairo produces 10,000 tons of waste material each day, 4,000 tons of which is not collected or managed. This is a huge health hazard, and the Egyptian Government is looking for ways to combat this. The Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Agency was founded to collect and recycle the waste; they work with the Zabbaleen community that has been collecting and recycling Cairo's waste since the turn of the 20th century and live in an area known locally as Manshiyat naser. Both are working together to pick up as much waste as possible within the city limits, though it remains a pressing problem.\nWater pollution is also a serious problem in the city as the sewer system tends to fail and overflow. On occasion, sewage has escaped onto the streets to create a health hazard. This problem is hoped to be solved by a new sewer system funded by the European Union, which could cope with the demand of the city. The dangerously high levels of mercury in the city's water system has global health officials concerned over related health risks.\nInternational relations.\nThe Headquarters of the Arab League is located in Tahrir Square, near the downtown business district of Cairo.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nCairo is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nPhotos and videos.\nLat.

{"id": "6295", "revid": "5855182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6295", "title": "Chaos theory", "text": "Field of mathematics\nChaos theory is an interdisciplinary area of scientific study and branch of mathematics focused on underlying patterns and deterministic laws of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, and were once thought to have completely random states of disorder and irregularities. Chaos theory states that within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, interconnection, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization. The butterfly effect, an underlying principle of chaos, describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state (meaning that there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions). A metaphor for this behavior is that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a tornado in Texas.\nSmall differences in initial conditions, such as those due to errors in measurements or due to rounding errors in numerical computation, can yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general. This can happen even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior follows a unique evolution and is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos. The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.\nChaotic behavior exists in many natural systems, including fluid flow, heartbeat irregularities, weather, and climate. It also occurs spontaneously in some systems with artificial components, such as the road traffic. This behavior can be studied through the analysis of a chaotic mathematical model, or through analytical techniques such as recurrence plots and Poincar\u00e9 maps. Chaos theory has applications in a variety of disciplines, including meteorology, anthropology, sociology, environmental science, computer science, engineering, economics, ecology, and pandemic crisis management. The theory formed the basis for such fields of study as complex dynamical systems, edge of chaos theory, and self-assembly processes.\nIntroduction.\nChaos theory concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can, in principle, be predicted. Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random. The amount of time for which the behavior of a chaotic system can be effectively predicted depends on three things: how much uncertainty can be tolerated in the forecast, how accurately its current state can be measured, and a time scale depending on the dynamics of the system, called the Lyapunov time. Some examples of Lyapunov times are: chaotic electrical circuits, about 1 millisecond; weather systems, a few days (unproven); the inner solar system, 4 to 5 million years. In chaotic systems, the uncertainty in a forecast increases exponentially with elapsed time. Hence, mathematically, doubling the forecast time more than squares the proportional uncertainty in the forecast. This means, in practice, a meaningful prediction cannot be made over an interval of more than two or three times the Lyapunov time. When meaningful predictions cannot be made, the system appears random.\nChaos theory is a method of qualitative and quantitative analysis to investigate the behavior of dynamic systems that cannot be explained and predicted by single data relationships, but must be explained and predicted by whole, continuous data relationships.\nChaotic dynamics.\nIn common usage, \"chaos\" means \"a state of disorder\". However, in chaos theory, the term is defined more precisely. Although no universally accepted mathematical definition of chaos exists, a commonly used definition, originally formulated by Robert L. Devaney, says that to classify a dynamical system as chaotic, it must have these properties:\nIn some cases, the last two properties above have been shown to actually imply sensitivity to initial conditions. In the discrete-time case, this is true for all continuous maps on metric spaces. In these cases, while it is often the most practically significant property, \"sensitivity to initial conditions\" need not be stated in the definition.\nIf attention is restricted to intervals, the second property implies the other two. An alternative and a generally weaker definition of chaos uses only the first two properties in the above list.\nSensitivity to initial conditions.\nSensitivity to initial conditions means that each point in a chaotic system is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points that have significantly different future paths or trajectories. Thus, an arbitrarily small change or perturbation of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behavior.\nSensitivity to initial conditions is popularly known as the \"butterfly effect\", so-called because of the title of a paper given by Edward Lorenz in 1972 to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C., entitled \"Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?\". The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events that prevents the predictability of large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the overall system could have been vastly different.\nAs suggested in Lorenz's book entitled \"The Essence of Chaos\", published in 1993, \"sensitive dependence can serve as an acceptable definition of chaos\". In the same book, Lorenz defined the butterfly effect as: \"The phenomenon that a small alteration in the state of a dynamical system will cause subsequent states to differ greatly from the states that would have followed without the alteration.\" The above definition is consistent with the sensitive dependence of solutions on initial conditions (SDIC). An idealized skiing model was developed to illustrate the sensitivity of time-varying paths to initial positions. A predictability horizon can be determined before the onset of SDIC (i.e., prior to significant separations of initial nearby trajectories).\nA consequence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that if we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time, the system would no longer be predictable. This is most prevalent in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead. This does not mean that one cannot assert anything about events far in the future\u2014only that some restrictions on the system are present. For example, we know that the temperature of the surface of the earth will not naturally reach or fall below on earth (during the current geologic era), but we cannot predict exactly which day will have the hottest temperature of the year.\nIn more mathematical terms, the Lyapunov exponent measures the sensitivity to initial conditions, in the form of rate of exponential divergence from the perturbed initial conditions. More specifically, given two starting trajectories in the phase space that are infinitesimally close, with initial separation formula_1, the two trajectories end up diverging at a rate given by\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3 is the time and formula_4 is the Lyapunov exponent. The rate of separation depends on the orientation of the initial separation vector, so a whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents can exist. The number of Lyapunov exponents is equal to the number of dimensions of the phase space, though it is common to just refer to the largest one. For example, the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) is most often used, because it determines the overall predictability of the system. A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic.\nIn addition to the above property, other properties related to sensitivity of initial conditions also exist. These include, for example, measure-theoretical mixing (as discussed in ergodic theory) and properties of a K-system.\nNon-periodicity.\nA chaotic system may have sequences of values for the evolving variable that exactly repeat themselves, giving periodic behavior starting from any point in that sequence. However, such periodic sequences are repelling rather than attracting, meaning that if the evolving variable is outside the sequence, however close, it will not enter the sequence and in fact, will diverge from it. Thus for almost all initial conditions, the variable evolves chaotically with non-periodic behavior.\nTopological mixing.\nTopological mixing (or the weaker condition of topological transitivity) means that the system evolves over time so that any given region or open set of its phase space eventually overlaps with any other given region. This mathematical concept of \"mixing\" corresponds to the standard intuition, and the mixing of colored dyes or fluids is an example of a chaotic system.\nTopological mixing is often omitted from popular accounts of chaos, which equate chaos with only sensitivity to initial conditions. However, sensitive dependence on initial conditions alone does not give chaos. For example, consider the simple dynamical system produced by repeatedly doubling an initial value. This system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions everywhere, since any pair of nearby points eventually becomes widely separated. However, this example has no topological mixing, and therefore has no chaos. Indeed, it has extremely simple behavior: all points except 0 tend to positive or negative infinity.\nTopological transitivity.\nA map formula_5 is said to be topologically transitive if for any pair of non-empty open sets formula_6, there exists formula_7 such that formula_8. Topological transitivity is a weaker version of topological mixing. Intuitively, if a map is topologically transitive then given a point \"x\" and a region \"V\", there exists a point \"y\" near \"x\" whose orbit passes through \"V\". This implies that it is impossible to decompose the system into two open sets.\nAn important related theorem is the Birkhoff Transitivity Theorem. It is easy to see that the existence of a dense orbit implies topological transitivity. The Birkhoff Transitivity Theorem states that if \"X\" is a second countable, complete metric space, then topological transitivity implies the existence of a dense set of points in \"X\" that have dense orbits.\nDensity of periodic orbits.\nFor a chaotic system to have dense periodic orbits means that every point in the space is approached arbitrarily closely by periodic orbits. The one-dimensional logistic map defined by \"x\" \u2192 4 \"x\" (1 \u2013 \"x\") is one of the simplest systems with density of periodic orbits. For example, formula_9\u00a0\u2192 formula_10\u00a0\u2192 formula_9 (or approximately 0.3454915\u00a0\u2192 0.9045085\u00a0\u2192 0.3454915) is an (unstable) orbit of period 2, and similar orbits exist for periods 4, 8, 16, etc. (indeed, for all the periods specified by Sharkovskii's theorem).\nSharkovskii's theorem is the basis of the Li and Yorke (1975) proof that any continuous one-dimensional system that exhibits a regular cycle of period three will also display regular cycles of every other length, as well as completely chaotic orbits.\nStrange attractors.\nSome dynamical systems, like the one-dimensional logistic map defined by \"x\" \u2192 4 \"x\" (1 \u2013 \"x\"), are chaotic everywhere, but in many cases chaotic behavior is found only in a subset of phase space. The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behavior takes place on an attractor, since then a large set of initial conditions leads to orbits that converge to this chaotic region.\nAn easy way to visualize a chaotic attractor is to start with a point in the basin of attraction of the attractor, and then simply plot its subsequent orbit. Because of the topological transitivity condition, this is likely to produce a picture of the entire final attractor, and indeed both orbits shown in the figure on the right give a picture of the general shape of the Lorenz attractor. This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the Lorenz weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known chaotic system diagrams, probably because it is not only one of the first, but it is also one of the most complex, and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern that, with a little imagination, looks like the wings of a butterfly.\nUnlike fixed-point attractors and limit cycles, the attractors that arise from chaotic systems, known as strange attractors, have great detail and complexity. Strange attractors occur in both continuous dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some discrete systems (such as the H\u00e9non map). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a Julia set, which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points. Julia sets can be thought of as strange repellers. Both strange attractors and Julia sets typically have a fractal structure, and the fractal dimension can be calculated for them.\nCoexisting attractors.\nIn contrast to single type chaotic solutions, recent studies using Lorenz models have emphasized the importance of considering various types of solutions. For example, coexisting chaotic and non-chaotic may appear within the same model (e.g., the double pendulum system) using the same modeling configurations but different initial conditions. The findings of attractor coexistence, obtained from classical and generalized Lorenz models, suggested a revised view that \"the entirety of weather possesses a dual nature of chaos and order with distinct predictability\", in contrast to the conventional view of \"weather is chaotic\".\nMinimum complexity of a chaotic system.\nDiscrete chaotic systems, such as the logistic map, can exhibit strange attractors whatever their dimensionality. Universality of one-dimensional maps with parabolic maxima and Feigenbaum constants formula_12,formula_13 is well visible with Tahn map proposed as a toy\nmodel for discrete laser dynamics:\nformula_14,\nwhere formula_15 stands for electric field amplitude, formula_16 is laser gain as bifurcation parameter. The gradual increase of formula_16 at interval formula_18 changes dynamics from regular to chaotic one with qualitatively the same bifurcation diagram as those for logistic map.\nIn contrast, for continuous dynamical systems, the Poincar\u00e9\u2013Bendixson theorem shows that a strange attractor can only arise in three or more dimensions. Finite-dimensional linear systems are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behavior, it must be either nonlinear or infinite-dimensional.\nThe Poincar\u00e9\u2013Bendixson theorem states that a two-dimensional differential equation has very regular behavior. The Lorenz attractor discussed below is generated by a system of three differential equations such as:\n formula_19\nwhere formula_15, formula_21, and formula_22 make up the system state, formula_3 is time, and formula_24, formula_25, formula_26 are the system parameters. Five of the terms on the right hand side are linear, while two are quadratic; a total of seven terms. Another well-known chaotic attractor is generated by the R\u00f6ssler equations, which have only one nonlinear term out of seven. Sprott found a three-dimensional system with just five terms, that had only one nonlinear term, which exhibits chaos for certain parameter values. Zhang and Heidel showed that, at least for dissipative and conservative quadratic systems, three-dimensional quadratic systems with only three or four terms on the right-hand side cannot exhibit chaotic behavior. The reason is, simply put, that solutions to such systems are asymptotic to a two-dimensional surface and therefore solutions are well behaved.\nWhile the Poincar\u00e9\u2013Bendixson theorem shows that a continuous dynamical system on the Euclidean plane cannot be chaotic, two-dimensional continuous systems with non-Euclidean geometry can exhibit chaotic behavior. Perhaps surprisingly, chaos may occur also in linear systems, provided they are infinite dimensional. A theory of linear chaos is being developed in a branch of mathematical analysis known as functional analysis.\nThe above elegant set of three ordinary differential equations has been referred to as the three-dimensional Lorenz model. Since 1963, higher-dimensional Lorenz models have been developed in numerous studies for examining the impact of an increased degree of nonlinearity, as well as its collective effect with heating and dissipations, on solution stability.\nInfinite dimensional maps.\nThe straightforward generalization of coupled discrete maps is based upon convolution integral which mediates interaction between spatially distributed maps:\nformula_27,\nwhere kernel formula_28 is propagator derived as Green function of a relevant physical system,\nformula_29 might be logistic map alike formula_30 or complex map. For examples of complex maps the Julia set formula_31 or Ikeda map\nformula_32 may serve. When wave propagation problems at distance formula_33 with wavelength formula_34 are considered the kernel formula_35 may have a form of Green function for Schr\u00f6dinger equation:.\nformula_36.\nJerk systems.\nIn physics, jerk is the third derivative of position, with respect to time. As such, differential equations of the form\n formula_37\nare sometimes called \"jerk equations\". It has been shown that a jerk equation, which is equivalent to a system of three first order, ordinary, non-linear differential equations, is in a certain sense the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behavior. This motivates mathematical interest in jerk systems. Systems involving a fourth or higher derivative are called accordingly hyperjerk systems.\nA jerk system's behavior is described by a jerk equation, and for certain jerk equations, simple electronic circuits can model solutions. These circuits are known as jerk circuits.\nOne of the most interesting properties of jerk circuits is the possibility of chaotic behavior. In fact, certain well-known chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor and the R\u00f6ssler map, are conventionally described as a system of three first-order differential equations that can combine into a single (although rather complicated) jerk equation. Another example of a jerk equation with nonlinearity in the magnitude of formula_15 is:\nformula_39\nHere, \"A\" is an adjustable parameter. This equation has a chaotic solution for \"A\"=3/5 and can be implemented with the following jerk circuit; the required nonlinearity is brought about by the two diodes:\nIn the above circuit, all resistors are of equal value, except formula_40, and all capacitors are of equal size. The dominant frequency is formula_41. The output of op amp 0 will correspond to the x variable, the output of 1 corresponds to the first derivative of x and the output of 2 corresponds to the second derivative.\nSimilar circuits only require one diode or no diodes at all.\nSee also the well-known Chua's circuit, one basis for chaotic true random number generators. The ease of construction of the circuit has made it a ubiquitous real-world example of a chaotic system.\nSpontaneous order.\nUnder the right conditions, chaos spontaneously evolves into a lockstep pattern. In the Kuramoto model, four conditions suffice to produce synchronization in a chaotic system.\nExamples include the coupled oscillation of Christiaan Huygens' pendulums, fireflies, neurons, the London Millennium Bridge resonance, and large arrays of Josephson junctions.\nHistory.\nAn early proponent of chaos theory was Henri Poincar\u00e9. In the 1880s, while studying the three-body problem, he found that there can be orbits that are nonperiodic, and yet not forever increasing nor approaching a fixed point. In 1898, Jacques Hadamard published an influential study of the chaotic motion of a free particle gliding frictionlessly on a surface of constant negative curvature, called \"Hadamard's billiards\". Hadamard was able to show that all trajectories are unstable, in that all particle trajectories diverge exponentially from one another, with a positive Lyapunov exponent.\nChaos theory began in the field of ergodic theory. Later studies, also on the topic of nonlinear differential equations, were carried out by George David Birkhoff, Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, Mary Lucy Cartwright and John Edensor Littlewood, and Stephen Smale. Except for Smale, these studies were all directly inspired by physics: the three-body problem in the case of Birkhoff, turbulence and astronomical problems in the case of Kolmogorov, and radio engineering in the case of Cartwright and Littlewood. Although chaotic planetary motion had not been observed, experimentalists had encountered turbulence in fluid motion and nonperiodic oscillation in radio circuits without the benefit of a theory to explain what they were seeing.\nDespite initial insights in the first half of the twentieth century, chaos theory became formalized as such only after mid-century, when it first became evident to some scientists that linear theory, the prevailing system theory at that time, simply could not explain the observed behavior of certain experiments like that of the logistic map. What had been attributed to measure imprecision and simple \"noise\" was considered by chaos theorists as a full component of the studied systems. In 1959 Boris Valerianovich Chirikov proposed a criterion for the emergence of classical chaos in Hamiltonian systems (Chirikov criterion). He applied this criterion to explain some experimental results on plasma confinement in open mirror traps. This is regarded as the very first physical theory of chaos, which succeeded in explaining a concrete experiment. And Boris Chirikov himself is considered as a pioneer in classical and quantum chaos.\nThe main catalyst for the development of chaos theory was the electronic computer. Much of the mathematics of chaos theory involves the repeated iteration of simple mathematical formulas, which would be impractical to do by hand. Electronic computers made these repeated calculations practical, while figures and images made it possible to visualize these systems. As a graduate student in Chihiro Hayashi's laboratory at Kyoto University, Yoshisuke Ueda was experimenting with analog computers and noticed, on November 27, 1961, what he called \"randomly transitional phenomena\". Yet his advisor did not agree with his conclusions at the time, and did not allow him to report his findings until 1970.\nEdward Lorenz was an early pioneer of the theory. His interest in chaos came about accidentally through his work on weather prediction in 1961. Lorenz and his collaborator Ellen Fetter were using a simple digital computer, a Royal McBee LGP-30, to run weather simulations. They wanted to see a sequence of data again, and to save time they started the simulation in the middle of its course. They did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions in the middle of the original simulation. To their surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. They tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome. Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to Lorenz attractors, showed that even detailed atmospheric modeling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.\nIn 1963, Benoit Mandelbrot, studying information theory, discovered that noise in many phenomena (including stock prices and telephone circuits) was patterned like a Cantor set, a set of points with infinite roughness and detail Mandelbrot described both the \"Noah effect\" (in which sudden discontinuous changes can occur) and the \"Joseph effect\" (in which persistence of a value can occur for a while, yet suddenly change afterwards). In 1967, he published \"How long is the coast of Britain? Statistical self-similarity and fractional dimension\", showing that a coastline's length varies with the scale of the measuring instrument, resembles itself at all scales, and is infinite in length for an infinitesimally small measuring device. Arguing that a ball of twine appears as a point when viewed from far away (0-dimensional), a ball when viewed from fairly near (3-dimensional), or a curved strand (1-dimensional), he argued that the dimensions of an object are relative to the observer and may be fractional. An object whose irregularity is constant over different scales (\"self-similarity\") is a fractal (examples include the Menger sponge, the Sierpi\u0144ski gasket, and the Koch curve or \"snowflake\", which is infinitely long yet encloses a finite space and has a fractal dimension of circa 1.2619). In 1982, Mandelbrot published \"The Fractal Geometry of Nature\", which became a classic of chaos theory.\nIn December 1977, the New York Academy of Sciences organized the first symposium on chaos, attended by David Ruelle, Robert May, James A. Yorke (coiner of the term \"chaos\" as used in mathematics), Robert Shaw, and the meteorologist Edward Lorenz. The following year Pierre Coullet and Charles Tresser published \"It\u00e9rations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation\", and Mitchell Feigenbaum's article \"Quantitative Universality for a Class of Nonlinear Transformations\" finally appeared in a journal, after 3 years of referee rejections. Thus Feigenbaum (1975) and Coullet &amp; Tresser (1978) discovered the universality in chaos, permitting the application of chaos theory to many different phenomena.\nIn 1979, Albert J. Libchaber, during a symposium organized in Aspen by Pierre Hohenberg, presented his experimental observation of the bifurcation cascade that leads to chaos and turbulence in Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection systems. He was awarded the Wolf Prize in Physics in 1986 along with Mitchell J. Feigenbaum for their inspiring achievements.\nIn 1986, the New York Academy of Sciences co-organized with the National Institute of Mental Health and the Office of Naval Research the first important conference on chaos in biology and medicine. There, Bernardo Huberman presented a mathematical model of the eye tracking dysfunction among people with schizophrenia. This led to a renewal of physiology in the 1980s through the application of chaos theory, for example, in the study of pathological cardiac cycles.\nIn 1987, Per Bak, Chao Tang and Kurt Wiesenfeld published a paper in \"Physical Review Letters\" describing for the first time self-organized criticality (SOC), considered one of the mechanisms by which complexity arises in nature.\nAlongside largely lab-based approaches such as the Bak\u2013Tang\u2013Wiesenfeld sandpile, many other investigations have focused on large-scale natural or social systems that are known (or suspected) to display scale-invariant behavior. Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including earthquakes, (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behavior such as the Gutenberg\u2013Richter law describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes, and the Omori law describing the frequency of aftershocks), solar flares, fluctuations in economic systems such as financial markets (references to SOC are common in econophysics), landscape formation, forest fires, landslides, epidemics, and biological evolution (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of \"punctuated equilibria\" put forward by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould). Given the implications of a scale-free distribution of event sizes, some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should be considered an example of SOC is the occurrence of wars. These investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system), and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.\nIn the same year, James Gleick published \"\", which became a best-seller and introduced the general principles of chaos theory as well as its history to the broad public. Initially the domain of a few, isolated individuals, chaos theory progressively emerged as a transdisciplinary and institutional discipline, mainly under the name of nonlinear systems analysis. Alluding to Thomas Kuhn's concept of a paradigm shift exposed in \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" (1962), many \"chaologists\" (as some described themselves) claimed that this new theory was an example of such a shift, a thesis upheld by Gleick.\nThe availability of cheaper, more powerful computers broadens the applicability of chaos theory. Currently, chaos theory remains an active area of research, involving many different disciplines such as mathematics, topology, physics, social systems, population modeling, biology, meteorology, astrophysics, information theory, computational neuroscience, pandemic crisis management, etc.\nA popular but inaccurate analogy for chaos.\nThe sensitive dependence on initial conditions (i.e., butterfly effect) has been illustrated using the following folklore:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For want of a nail, the shoe was lost.\nFor want of a shoe, the horse was lost.\nFor want of a horse, the rider was lost.\nFor want of a rider, the battle was lost.\nFor want of a battle, the kingdom was lost.\nAnd all for the want of a horseshoe nail.\nBased on the above, many people mistakenly believe that the impact of a tiny initial perturbation monotonically increases with time and that any tiny perturbation can eventually produce a large impact on numerical integrations. However, in 2008, Lorenz stated that he did not feel that this verse described true chaos but that it better illustrated the simpler phenomenon of instability and that the verse implicitly suggests that subsequent small events will not reverse the outcome (Lorenz, 2008 ). Based on the analysis, the verse only indicates divergence, not boundedness. Boundedness is important for the finite size of a butterfly pattern. In a recent study, the characteristic of the aforementioned verse was recently denoted as \"finite-time sensitive dependence\".\nApplications.\nAlthough chaos theory was born from observing weather patterns, it has become applicable to a variety of other situations. Some areas benefiting from chaos theory today are geology, mathematics, biology, computer science, economics, engineering, finance, meteorology, philosophy, anthropology, physics, politics, population dynamics, and robotics. A few categories are listed below with examples, but this is by no means a comprehensive list as new applications are appearing.\nCryptography.\nChaos theory has been used for many years in cryptography. In the past few decades, chaos and nonlinear dynamics have been used in the design of hundreds of cryptographic primitives. These algorithms include image encryption algorithms, hash functions, secure pseudo-random number generators, stream ciphers, watermarking, and steganography. The majority of these algorithms are based on uni-modal chaotic maps and a big portion of these algorithms use the control parameters and the initial condition of the chaotic maps as their keys. From a wider perspective, without loss of generality, the similarities between the chaotic maps and the cryptographic systems is the main motivation for the design of chaos based cryptographic algorithms. One type of encryption, secret key or symmetric key, relies on diffusion and confusion, which is modeled well by chaos theory. Another type of computing, DNA computing, when paired with chaos theory, offers a way to encrypt images and other information. Many of the DNA-Chaos cryptographic algorithms are proven to be either not secure, or the technique applied is suggested to be not efficient.\nRobotics.\nRobotics is another area that has recently benefited from chaos theory. Instead of robots acting in a trial-and-error type of refinement to interact with their environment, chaos theory has been used to build a predictive model.\nChaotic dynamics have been exhibited by passive walking biped robots.\nBiology.\nFor over a hundred years, biologists have been keeping track of populations of different species with population models. Most models are continuous, but recently scientists have been able to implement chaotic models in certain populations. For example, a study on models of Canadian lynx showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth. Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as hydrology. While a chaotic model for hydrology has its shortcomings, there is still much to learn from looking at the data through the lens of chaos theory. Another biological application is found in cardiotocography. Fetal surveillance is a delicate balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of fetal hypoxia can be obtained through chaotic modeling.\nAs Perry points out, modeling of chaotic time series in ecology is helped by constraint. There is always potential difficulty in distinguishing real chaos from chaos that is only in the model. Hence both constraint in the model and or duplicate time series data for comparison will be helpful in constraining the model to something close to the reality, for example Perry &amp; Wall 1984. Gene-for-gene co-evolution sometimes shows chaotic dynamics in allele frequencies. Adding variables exaggerates this: Chaos is more common in models incorporating additional variables to reflect additional facets of real populations. Robert M. May himself did some of these foundational crop co-evolution studies, and this in turn helped shape the entire field. Even for a steady environment, merely combining one crop and one pathogen may result in quasi-periodic- or chaotic- oscillations in pathogen population.169\nEconomics.\nIt is possible that economic models can also be improved through an application of chaos theory, but predicting the health of an economic system and what factors influence it most is an extremely complex task. Economic and financial systems are fundamentally different from those in the classical natural sciences since the former are inherently stochastic in nature, as they result from the interactions of people, and thus pure deterministic models are unlikely to provide accurate representations of the data. The empirical literature that tests for chaos in economics and finance presents very mixed results, in part due to confusion between specific tests for chaos and more general tests for non-linear relationships.\nChaos could be found in economics by the means of recurrence quantification analysis. In fact, Orlando et al. by the means of the so-called recurrence quantification correlation index were able detect hidden changes in time series. Then, the same technique was employed to detect transitions from laminar (regular) to turbulent (chaotic) phases as well as differences between macroeconomic variables and highlight hidden features of economic dynamics. Finally, chaos theory could help in modeling how an economy operates as well as in embedding shocks due to external events such as COVID-19.\nOther areas.\nIn chemistry, predicting gas solubility is essential to manufacturing polymers, but models using particle swarm optimization (PSO) tend to converge to the wrong points. An improved version of PSO has been created by introducing chaos, which keeps the simulations from getting stuck. In celestial mechanics, especially when observing asteroids, applying chaos theory leads to better predictions about when these objects will approach Earth and other planets. Four of the five moons of Pluto rotate chaotically. In quantum physics and electrical engineering, the study of large arrays of Josephson junctions benefitted greatly from chaos theory. Closer to home, coal mines have always been dangerous places where frequent natural gas leaks cause many deaths. Until recently, there was no reliable way to predict when they would occur. But these gas leaks have chaotic tendencies that, when properly modeled, can be predicted fairly accurately.\nChaos theory can be applied outside of the natural sciences, but historically nearly all such studies have suffered from lack of reproducibility; poor external validity; and/or inattention to cross-validation, resulting in poor predictive accuracy (if out-of-sample prediction has even been attempted). Glass and Mandell and Selz have found that no EEG study has as yet indicated the presence of strange attractors or other signs of chaotic behavior.\nResearchers have continued to apply chaos theory to psychology. For example, in modeling group behavior in which heterogeneous members may behave as if sharing to different degrees what in Wilfred Bion's theory is a basic assumption, researchers have found that the group dynamic is the result of the individual dynamics of the members: each individual reproduces the group dynamics in a different scale, and the chaotic behavior of the group is reflected in each member.\nRedington and Reidbord (1992) attempted to demonstrate that the human heart could display chaotic traits. They monitored the changes in between-heartbeat intervals for a single psychotherapy patient as she moved through periods of varying emotional intensity during a therapy session. Results were admittedly inconclusive. Not only were there ambiguities in the various plots the authors produced to purportedly show evidence of chaotic dynamics (spectral analysis, phase trajectory, and autocorrelation plots), but also when they attempted to compute a Lyapunov exponent as more definitive confirmation of chaotic behavior, the authors found they could not reliably do so.\nIn their 1995 paper, Metcalf and Allen maintained that they uncovered in animal behavior a pattern of period doubling leading to chaos. The authors examined a well-known response called schedule-induced polydipsia, by which an animal deprived of food for certain lengths of time will drink unusual amounts of water when the food is at last presented. The control parameter (r) operating here was the length of the interval between feedings, once resumed. The authors were careful to test a large number of animals and to include many replications, and they designed their experiment so as to rule out the likelihood that changes in response patterns were caused by different starting places for r.\nTime series and first delay plots provide the best support for the claims made, showing a fairly clear march from periodicity to irregularity as the feeding times were increased. The various phase trajectory plots and spectral analyses, on the other hand, do not match up well enough with the other graphs or with the overall theory to lead inexorably to a chaotic diagnosis. For example, the phase trajectories do not show a definite progression towards greater and greater complexity (and away from periodicity); the process seems quite muddied. Also, where Metcalf and Allen saw periods of two and six in their spectral plots, there is room for alternative interpretations. All of this ambiguity necessitate some serpentine, post-hoc explanation to show that results fit a chaotic model.\nBy adapting a model of career counseling to include a chaotic interpretation of the relationship between employees and the job market, Amundson and Bright found that better suggestions can be made to people struggling with career decisions. Modern organizations are increasingly seen as open complex adaptive systems with fundamental natural nonlinear structures, subject to internal and external forces that may contribute chaos. For instance, team building and group development is increasingly being researched as an inherently unpredictable system, as the uncertainty of different individuals meeting for the first time makes the trajectory of the team unknowable.\nSome say the chaos metaphor\u2014used in verbal theories\u2014grounded on mathematical models and psychological aspects of human behavior\nprovides helpful insights to describing the complexity of small work groups, that go beyond the metaphor itself.\nTraffic forecasting may benefit from applications of chaos theory. Better predictions of when a congestion will occur would allow measures to be taken to disperse it before it would have occurred. Combining chaos theory principles with a few other methods has led to a more accurate short-term prediction model (see the plot of the BML traffic model at right).\nChaos theory has been applied to environmental water cycle data (also hydrological data), such as rainfall and streamflow. These studies have yielded controversial results, because the methods for detecting a chaotic signature are often relatively subjective. Early studies tended to \"succeed\" in finding chaos, whereas subsequent studies and meta-analyses called those studies into question and provided explanations for why these datasets are not likely to have low-dimension chaotic dynamics.\nIn art (predominately art theory) a possible postpostmodern era has been outlined with emphasis on multiple narratives and the notion that every fictional angle is a possibility. In part this is therefor of a bisociate (trissociative) discourse and can be explained within emphasis on an institutional interchange of subjectivistic agents.\nSee also.\nExamples of chaotic systems\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther related topics\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPeople\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Being weatherproof, the cupola was better suited to the wetter climates of northern Europe. The chhatri, seen in Indian architecture, fits the definition of a cupola when it is used atop a larger structure.\nCupolas often serve as a belfry, belvedere, or roof lantern above a main roof. In other cases they may crown a spire, tower, or turret. Barns often have cupolas for ventilation.\nCupolas can also appear as small buildings in their own right.\nThe square, dome-like segment of a North American railroad train caboose that contains the second-level or \"angel\" seats is also called a cupola.\nOn armoured vehicles.\nThe term cupola can also refer to the protrusions atop an armoured fighting vehicle due to their distinctive dome-like appearance. They allow crew or personnel to observe, offering very good all round vision, or even field weaponry, without being exposed to incoming fire. Later designs, however, became progressively flatter and less prominent as technology evolved to allow designers to reduce the profile of their vehicles. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6299", "revid": "1071745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6299", "title": "Chupacabra", "text": "Legendary creature in American folklore\nThe chupacabra or chupacabras (], literally 'goat-sucker'; from , 'sucks', and , 'goats') is a legendary creature in the folklore of parts of the Americas. The name comes from the animal's reported vampirism\u2014the chupacabra is said to attack and drink the blood of livestock, including goats.\nPhysical descriptions of the creature vary, some describe it as reptilian and alien-like (in Puerto Rico and Latin America), generally as a heavy creature the size of a small bear with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail. Others depict it as more dog-like (particularly in Southwestern United States).\nSightings, and the initial descriptions, were first reported in Puerto Rico in 1995. The creature has since been reported as far north as Maine, as far south as Chile, and even outside the Americas in countries like Russia and Philippines. All of the reports are anecdotal and have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence. Sightings in northern Mexico and the southern United States have been verified as canids afflicted by mange. According to biologists and wildlife management officials, the chupacabra is an urban legend.\nName.\n can be literally translated as 'goat-sucker', from ('to suck') and ('goats'). It is known as both and throughout the Americas, with the former being the original name, and the latter a regularization. The name is attributed to Puerto Rican comedian Silverio P\u00e9rez, who coined the label in 1995 while commenting on the attacks as a San Juan radio deejay.\nHistory.\nIn 1975, a series of livestock killings in the small town of Moca, Puerto Rico were attributed to ('the vampire of Moca'). Initially, it was suspected that the killings were committed by a Satanic cult; later more killings were reported around the island, and many farms reported loss of animal life. Each of the animals was reported to have had its body bled dry through a series of small circular incisions.\nThe first reported attack eventually attributed to the actual chupacabras occurred in March 1995. Eight sheep were discovered dead in Puerto Rico, each with three puncture wounds in the chest area and reportedly completely drained of blood. A few months later, in August, an eyewitness named Madelyne Tolentino reported seeing the creature in the Puerto Rican town of Can\u00f3vanas, where as many as 150 farm animals and pets were reportedly killed.\nPuerto Rican comedian and entrepreneur Silverio P\u00e9rez is credited with coining the term soon after the first incidents were reported in the press. Shortly after the first reported incidents in Puerto Rico, other animal deaths were reported in other countries, such as Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and the United States.\nIn October and December 2018, there came many reports of suspected chupacabras in Manipur, India. Many domestic animals and poultry were killed in a suspicious manner similar to other chupacabra attacks, and several people reported that they had seen chupacabras. However, forensic experts opined that street dogs were responsible for mass killing of domestic animals and poultry after studying the remnants of a corpse.\nIn October 2019, a video recorded by showed the results of a supposed attack on chickens in the Seburuquillo sector of Lares, Puerto Rico.\nReputed origin.\nA five-year investigation by Benjamin Radford, documented in his 2011 book \"Tracking the Chupacabra\", concluded that the description given by the original eyewitness in Puerto Rico, Madelyne Tolentino, was based on the creature Sil in the 1995 science-fiction horror film \"Species\". The alien creature Sil is nearly identical to Tolentino's chupacabra eyewitness account and she had seen the movie before her report: \"It was a creature that looked like the chupacabra, with spines on its back and all... The resemblance to the chupacabra was really impressive\", Tolentino reported. Radford revealed that Tolentino \"believed that the creatures and events she saw in \"Species\" were happening in reality in Puerto Rico at the time\", and therefore concludes that \"the most important chupacabra description cannot be trusted\". This, Radford believes, seriously undermines the credibility of the chupacabra as a real animal.\nIn addition, the reports of blood-sucking by the chupacabra were never confirmed by a necropsy, the only way to conclude that the animal was drained of blood. Dr. David Morales, a Puerto Rican veterinarian with the Department of Agriculture, analyzed 300 reported victims of the chupacabra and found that they had not been bled dry.\nRadford divided the chupacabra reports into two categories: the reports from Puerto Rico and Latin America, where animals were attacked and it is supposed their blood was extracted; and the reports in the United States of mammals, mostly dogs and coyotes with mange, that people call \"chupacabra\" due to their unusual appearance.\nIn late October 2010, University of Michigan biologist Barry O'Connor concluded that all the chupacabra reports in the United States were simply coyotes infected with the parasite \"Sarcoptes scabiei\", whose symptoms would explain most of the features of the chupacabra: they would be left with little fur, thickened skin, and a rank odor. O'Connor theorized that the attacks on goats occurred \"because these animals are greatly weakened, [so] they're going to have a hard time hunting. So they may be forced into attacking livestock because it's easier than running down a rabbit or a deer.\"\nAlthough several witnesses came to the conclusion that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect. Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey. The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal bleeding or circulatory shock. The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the canine teeth, are to be expected since this is the only way that most land carnivores have to catch their prey.\nThere are reports of stray Mexican hairless dogs being mistaken for chupacabras.\nAppearance.\nThe most common description of the chupacabra is that of a reptile-like creature, said to have leathery or scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back. It is said to be approximately high, and stands and hops in a fashion similar to that of a kangaroo.\nAnother common description of the chupacabra is of a strange breed of wild dog. This form is mostly hairless and has a pronounced spinal ridge, unusually pronounced eye sockets, fangs, and claws. Unlike conventional predators, the chupacabra is said to drain all of the animal's blood (and sometimes organs) usually through three holes in the shape of a downwards-pointing triangle, but sometimes through only one or two holes.\nRelated legends.\nThe \"Ozark Howler\", a large bear-like animal, is the subject of a similar urban legend.\nThe Peuchens of Chile also share similarities in their supposed habits, but instead of being dog-like they are described as winged snakes. This legend may have originated from the vampire bat, an animal endemic to the region.\nIn the Philippines, another legendary creature called the Sigbin shares many of the chupacabra's descriptions.\n\"Grunches\" is a legend in New Orleans that gets its name from a lovers' lane called Grunch Road, between the Mississippi river and the Gulf of Mexico. The road was said to be inhabited by creatures called \"grunches\", similar in appearance to the Chupacabra. \nIn popular culture.\nThe popularity of the chupacabra has resulted in it being featured in many types of media:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is just under long. Its average width is , and it is at its widest point, near Aurora. It is approximately at its deepest point, and has over of shoreline.\nThe lake is named after the indigenous Cayuga people.\nLocation.\nThe city of Ithaca, site of Ithaca College and Cornell University, is located at the southern end of Cayuga Lake.\nVillages and settlements along the east shore of Cayuga Lake include Myers, King Ferry, Aurora, Levanna, Union Springs, and Cayuga. Settlements along the west shore of the lake include Sheldrake, Poplar Beach, and Canoga.\nThe lake has two small islands. One is near Union Springs, called Frontenac Island (northeast); this island is not inhabited. The other island, Canoga Island (northwest), is located near the town of Canoga. This island has several camps and is inhabited during the summer months. The only other island in any of the Finger Lakes is Skenoh Island in Canandaigua Lake.\nGeographical characteristics.\nCayuga Lake is located at ; above sea level. Its depth, with steep east and west sides and shallow north and south ends, is typical of the Finger Lakes, as they were carved by glaciers during the last ice age.\nThe water level is regulated by the Mud Lock at the north end of the lake. It is connected to Lake Ontario by the Erie Canal and Seneca Lake by the Seneca River. The lake is drawn down as winter approaches, to minimize ice damage and to maximize its capacity to store heavy spring runoff.\nThe north end is dominated by shallow mudflats. An important stopover for migratory birds, the mudflats and marsh are the location of the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge. The southern end is also shallow and often freezes during the winter.\nHuman impact.\nCayuga Lake is very popular among recreational boaters. The Allan H. Treman State Marine Park, with a large state marina and boat launch, is located at the southern end of the lake in Ithaca. There are two yacht clubs on the western shore: Ithaca Yacht Club, a few miles north of Ithaca, and Red Jacket Yacht Club, just south of Canoga. There are several other marinas and boat launches, scattered along the lake shore.\nCayuga Lake is the source of drinking water for several communities, including Lansing, near the southern end of the lake along the east side, which draws water through the Bolton Point Water System. There are also several lake source cooling systems that are in operation on the lake, whereby cooler water is pumped from the depths of the lake, warmed, and circulated in a closed system back to the surface. One of these systems, which is operated by Cornell University and began operation in 2000, was controversial during the planning and building stages, due to its potential for having a negative environmental impact. However, all of the environmental impact reports and scientific studies have shown that the Cornell lake source cooling system has not yet had, and will not likely have any measurably significant environmental impact. Furthermore, Cornell's system pumps significantly less warm water back into the lake than others further north, which have been operating for decades, including the coal-fired power plant on the eastern shore.\nThe AES Coal Power plant was shut down in August 2019, and there are plans to convert it into a data center in the near future. The plant used to use Cayuga Lake as a cooling source. In the late 1960s, citizens successfully opposed the construction of an 830-MW nuclear power plant on the shore of Cayuga Lake.\nRod Serling named his production company Cayuga Productions, during the years of his TV series, \"The Twilight Zone\". Serling and his family had a summer home at Cayuga Lake.\nFishing.\nThe fish population is managed and substantial sport fishing is practiced, with anglers targeting smelt, lake trout and smallmouth bass. Fish species present in the lake include lake trout, landlocked salmon, brown trout, rainbow trout, smallmouth bass, smelt, alewife, atlantic salmon, black crappie, bluegill, pickerel, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and yellow perch. There are state owned hard surface ramps in Cayuga\u2013Seneca Canal, Lock #1 (Mud Lock), Long Point State Park, Cayuga Lake State Park, Deans Cove Boat Launch, Taughannock Falls State Park, and Allan H. Treman State Marine Park.\nTributaries.\nThe major inflows to the lake are: Fall Creek, Cayuga Inlet, Salmon Creek, Taughannock Creek, and Six Mile Creek; while the lake outflows into the Seneca River and other tributaries. Ungaged tributaries that inflow to the lake include: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFolklore.\nThe lake is the subject of local folklore. \nAn \"Ithaca Journal\" article of January 5, 1897, reported that a sea serpent, nicknamed \"Old Greeny,\" had been sighted in Cayuga Lake annually for 69 years. A sighting in that month described the animal, from shore, as \"large and its body long,\" though a \"tramp\" suggested it was a muskrat. In 1929, two creatures, about in length, were reportedly spotted along the eastern shore of the lake. Further sightings were reported in 1974 and 1979.\nCornell's alma mater makes reference to its position \"Far Above Cayuga's Waters\", while that of Ithaca College references \"Cayuga's shore\".\nA tradition at Wells College in Aurora holds that if the lake completely freezes over, classes are canceled (though for only one day). According to Wells College records, this most recently happened in 1979 and the record cold month of February 2015. However, other sources suggest that the only time the entire lake froze over solid end to end in the 20th century was in 1912, when even the deeper Seneca Lake last froze over completely.\nCayuga Lake, like nearby Seneca Lake, is also the site of a phenomenon known as the Guns of the Seneca, mysterious cannon-like booms heard in the surrounding area. Many of these booms may be attributable to bird-scarers, automated cannon-like devices used by farmers to scare birds away from the many vineyards, orchards and crops. There is, however, no proof of this.\nWine.\nCayuga Lake is included in the American Viticultural Area with which it shares its name. Established in 1988, the AVA now boasts over a dozen wineries, four distilleries, a cidery, and a meadery.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The university's research efforts include the Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and accelerator laboratories with Big Tech firms such as Amazon and IBM. Columbia is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and was the first school in the United States to grant the MD degree. The university also annually administers the Pulitzer Prize. With over 15 million volumes, Columbia University Library is the third-largest private research library in the United States.\nThe university's endowment stands at $13.3 billion in 2022, among the largest of any academic institution. As of December\u00a02021[ [update]], its alumni, faculty, and staff have included seven Founding Fathers of the United States; four U.S. presidents; 33 foreign heads of state; two secretaries-general of the United Nations; ten justices of the United States Supreme Court; 101 Nobel laureates; 125 National Academy of Sciences members; 53 living billionaires; 22 Olympic medalists; 33 Academy Award winners; and 125 Pulitzer Prize recipients.\nHistory.\nColonial period.\nDiscussions regarding the founding of a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704, at which time Colonel Lewis Morris wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the missionary arm of the Church of England, persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college. However, it was not until the founding of the College of New Jersey (renamed Princeton) across the Hudson River in New Jersey that the City of New York seriously considered founding a college. In 1746, an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the Church of England, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.\nClasses were initially held in July 1754 and were presided over by the college's first president, Samuel Johnson. Johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class, which consisted of a mere eight students. Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church, located on what is now lower Broadway in Manhattan. The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of George II, making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the State of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States.\nIn 1763, Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by Myles Cooper, a graduate of The Queen's College, Oxford, and an ardent Tory. In the charged political climate of the American Revolution, his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, Alexander Hamilton. The Irish anatomist, Samuel Clossy, was appointed professor of natural philosophy in October 1765 and later the college's first professor of anatomy in 1767. The American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of King's College, which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the Continental Army. The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.\n18th century.\nAfter the Revolution, the college turned to the State of New York in order to restore its vitality, promising to make whatever changes to the school's charter the state might demand. The legislature agreed to assist the college, and on May 1, 1784, it passed \"an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College\". The Act created a board of regents to oversee the resuscitation of King's College, and, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the legislature stipulated that \"the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of Columbia College\", a reference to Columbia, an alternative name for America which in turn comes from the name of Christopher Columbus. The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by John Jay and Alexander Hamilton. In April of that same year, a new charter was adopted for the college granted the power to a separate board of 24 trustees.\nOn May 21, 1787, William Samuel Johnson, the son of Samuel Johnson, was unanimously elected president of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the university, Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention. For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. President George Washington and Vice President John Adams, in addition to both houses of Congress attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution.\n19th century to present.\nIn November 1813, the college agreed to incorporate its medical school with The College of Physicians and Surgeons, a new school created by the Regents of New York, forming Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. The college's enrollment, structure, and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century, with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the college functioned. In 1857, the college moved from the King's College campus at Park Place to a primarily Gothic Revival campus on 49th Street and Madison Avenue, where it remained for the next forty years. During the last half of the 19th century, under the leadership of President F.A.P. Barnard, the president that Barnard College is named after, the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university. Barnard College was created in 1889 as a response to the university's refusal to accept women. By this time, the college's investments in New York real estate became a primary source of steady income for the school, mainly owing to the city's expanding population. In 1896, university president Seth Low moved the campus from 49th\u00a0Street to its present location, a more spacious campus in the developing neighborhood of Morningside Heights. Under the leadership of Low's successor, Nicholas Murray Butler, who served for over four decades, Columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for research, setting the \"multiversity\" model that later universities would adopt. Prior to becoming the president of Columbia University, Butler founded Teachers College, as a school to prepare home economists and manual art teachers for the children of the poor, with philanthropist Grace Hoadley Dodge. Teachers College is currently affiliated as the university's Graduate School of Education.\nResearch into the atom by faculty members John R. Dunning, I. I. Rabi, Enrico Fermi and Polykarp Kusch placed Columbia's physics department in the international spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the Manhattan Project. In 1928, Seth Low Junior College was established by Columbia University in order to mitigate the number of Jewish applicants to Columbia College. The college was closed in 1936 due to the adverse effects of the Great Depression and its students were subsequently taught at Morningside Heights, although they did not belong to any college but to the university at large.\nThere was an evening school called University Extension, which taught night classes, for a fee, to anyone willing to attend. In 1947, the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the School of General Studies in response to the return of GIs after World War II. In 1995, the School of General Studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non-traditional students (those who have had an academic break of one year or more, or are pursuing dual-degrees) and was fully integrated into Columbia's traditional undergraduate curriculum. Within the same year, the Division of Special Programs\u2014later the School of Continuing Education, and now the School of Professional Studies\u2014was established to reprise the former role of University Extension. While the School of Professional Studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong learners and high school students in its earliest stages, it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields.\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the discipline of international relations became a major scholarly focus of the university, and in response, the School of International and Public Affairs was founded in 1946, drawing upon the resources of the faculties of political science, economics, and history. The Columbia University Bicentennial was celebrated in 1954.\nDuring the 1960s Columbia experienced large-scale student activism, which reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied buildings on campus. The incident forced the resignation of Columbia's president, Grayson Kirk, and the establishment of the University Senate.\nThough several schools within the university had admitted women for years, Columbia College first admitted women in the fall of 1983, after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard College, the all-female institution affiliated with the university, to merge the two schools. Barnard College still remains affiliated with Columbia, and all Barnard graduates are issued diplomas signed by the presidents of Columbia University and Barnard College.\nDuring the late 20th century, the university underwent significant academic, structural, and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university. For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.\nCampus.\nMorningside Heights.\nThe majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts planning principles by the architects McKim, Mead &amp; White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or , in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive tunnel system, more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.\nThe Nicholas Murray Butler Library, known simply as Butler Library, is the largest single library in the Columbia University Library System, and is one of the largest buildings on the campus. Proposed as \"South Hall\" by the university's former president Nicholas Murray Butler as expansion plans for Low Memorial Library stalled, the new library was funded by Edward Harkness, benefactor of Yale's residential college system, and designed by his favorite architect, James Gamble Rogers. It was completed in 1934 and renamed for Butler in 1946. The library design is neo-classical in style. Its facade features a row of columns in the Ionic order above which are inscribed the names of great writers, philosophers, and thinkers, most of whom are read by students engaged in the Core Curriculum of Columbia College. As of 2020[ [update]], Columbia's library system includes over 15.0 million volumes, making it the eighth largest library system and fifth largest collegiate library system in the United States.\nSeveral buildings on the Morningside Heights campus are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Low Memorial Library, a National Historic Landmark and the centerpiece of the campus, is listed for its architectural significance. Philosophy Hall is listed as the site of the invention of FM radio. Also listed is Pupin Hall, another National Historic Landmark, which houses the physics and astronomy departments. Here the first experiments on the fission of uranium were conducted by Enrico Fermi. The uranium atom was split there ten days after the world's first atom-splitting in Copenhagen, Denmark. Other buildings listed include Casa Italiana, the Delta Psi, Alpha Chapter building of St. Anthony Hall, Earl Hall, and the buildings of the affiliated Union Theological Seminary.\nA statue by sculptor Daniel Chester French called \"Alma Mater\" is centered on the front steps of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead &amp; White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a royal charter institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.\n\"The Steps\", alternatively known as \"Low Steps\" or the \"Urban Beach\", are a popular meeting area for Columbia students. The term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus (South Field) to its upper terrace. With a design inspired by the City Beautiful movement, the steps of Low Library provides Columbia University and Barnard College students, faculty, and staff with a comfortable outdoor platform and space for informal gatherings, events, and ceremonies. McKim's classical facade epitomizes late 19th-century new-classical designs, with its columns and portico marking the entrance to an important structure.\nOther campuses.\nIn April 2007, the university purchased more than two-thirds of a site for a new campus in Manhattanville, an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus. Stretching from 125th Street to 133rd Street, Columbia Manhattanville houses buildings for Columbia's Business School, School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia School of the Arts, and the Jerome L. Greene Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The $7\u00a0billion expansion plan included demolishing all buildings, except three that are historically significant (the Studebaker Building, Prentis Hall, and the Nash Building), eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses, and relocating tenants in 132\u00a0apartments. Replacing these buildings created of space for the university. Community activist groups in West Harlem fought the expansion for reasons ranging from property protection and fair exchange for land, to residents' rights. Subsequent public hearings drew neighborhood opposition. As of \u00a02008[ [update]], the State of New York's Empire State Development Corporation approved use of eminent domain, which, through declaration of Manhattanville's \"blighted\" status, gives governmental bodies the right to appropriate private property for public use. On May 20, 2009, the New York State Public Authorities Control Board approved the Manhanttanville expansion plan.\nNewYork-Presbyterian Hospital is affiliated with the medical schools of both Columbia University and Cornell University. According to \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\"'s \"2020\u201321 Best Hospitals Honor Roll and Medical Specialties Rankings\", it is ranked fourth overall and second among university hospitals. Columbia's medical school has a strategic partnership with New York State Psychiatric Institute, and is affiliated with 19 other hospitals in the U.S. and four hospitals in other countries. Health-related schools are located at the Columbia University Medical Center, a campus located in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, fifty blocks uptown. Other teaching hospitals affiliated with Columbia through the NewYork-Presbyterian network include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan, and the Payne Whitney Westchester, a psychiatric institute located in White Plains, New York. On the northern tip of Manhattan island (in the neighborhood of Inwood), Columbia owns the Baker Field, which includes the Lawrence A. Wien Stadium as well as facilities for field sports, outdoor track, and tennis. There is a third campus on the west bank of the Hudson River, the Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory and Earth Institute in Palisades, New York. A fourth is the Nevis Laboratories in Irvington, New York, for the study of particle and motion physics. A satellite site in Paris holds classes at Reid Hall.\nSustainability.\nIn 2006, the university established the Office of Environmental Stewardship to initiate, coordinate and implement programs to reduce the university's environmental footprint. The U.S. Green Building Council selected the university's Manhattanville plan for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Neighborhood Design pilot program. The plan commits to incorporating smart growth, new urbanism and \"green\" building design principles. Columbia is one of the 2030 Challenge Partners, a group of nine universities in the city of New York that have pledged to reduce their greenhouse emissions by 30% within the next ten years. Columbia University adopts LEED standards for all new construction and major renovations. The university requires a minimum of Silver, but through its design and review process seeks to achieve higher levels. This is especially challenging for lab and research buildings with their intensive energy use; however, the university also uses lab design guidelines that seek to maximize energy efficiency while protecting the safety of researchers.\nEvery Thursday and Sunday of the month, Columbia hosts a greenmarket where local farmers can sell their produce to residents of the city. In addition, from April to November Hodgson's farm, a local New York gardening center, joins the market bringing a large selection of plants and blooming flowers. The market is one of the many operated at different points throughout the city by the non-profit group GrowNYC. Dining services at Columbia spends 36 percent of its food budget on local products, in addition to serving sustainably harvested seafood and fair trade coffee on campus. Columbia has been rated \"B+\" by the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Columbia University would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (\"104\") with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (\"25\").\nTransportation.\nColumbia Transportation is the bus service of the university, operated by Academy Bus Lines. The buses are open to all Columbia faculty, students, Dodge Fitness Center members, and anyone else who holds a Columbia ID card. In addition, all TSC students can ride the buses.\nIn the New York City Subway, the train serves the university at 116th Street-Columbia University. The buses stop on Broadway while the stops on Amsterdam Avenue.\nAcademics.\nUndergraduate admissions and financial aid.\nColumbia University received 60,551 applications for the class of 2025 (entering 2021) and a total of around 2,218 were admitted to the two schools for an overall acceptance rate of 3.66%. Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516. In 2015\u20132016, annual undergraduate tuition at Columbia was $50,526 with a total cost of attendance of $65,860 (including room and board). The college is need-blind for domestic applicants.\nAnnual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400 million donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education. As of 2008[ [update]], undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and then-current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies. In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.\nScholarships are also given to undergraduate students by the admissions committee. Designations include John W. Kluge Scholars, John Jay Scholars, C. Prescott Davis Scholars, Global Scholars, Egleston Scholars, and Science Research Fellows. Named scholars are selected by the admission committee from first-year applicants. According to Columbia, the first four designated scholars \"distinguish themselves for their remarkable academic and personal achievements, dynamism, intellectual curiosity, the originality and independence of their thinking, and the diversity that stems from their different cultures and their varied educational experiences\".\nIn 1919, Columbia established a student application process characterized by \"The New York Times\" as \"the first modern college application\". The application required a photograph of the applicant, the maiden name of the applicant's mother, and the applicant's religious background.\nOrganization.\nColumbia University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York\". The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves \"ex officio\". The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The trustees appoint the president and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.\nThe University Senate was established by the trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the provost, the deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all of whom serve \"ex officio\", and five additional representatives, appointed by the president, from the university's administration. The president serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university. It oversees the welfare and academic freedom of the faculty and the welfare of students.\nThe president of Columbia University, who is selected by the trustees in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate and who serves at the trustees' pleasure, is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the president in administering the university are the provost, the senior executive vice president, the executive vice president for health and biomedical sciences, several other vice presidents, the general counsel, the secretary of the university, and the deans of the faculties, all of whom are appointed by the trustees on the nomination of the president and serve at their pleasure. Lee C. Bollinger became the 19th president of Columbia University on June 1, 2002. As president of the University of Michigan, he played a leading role in the twin Supreme Court cases Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger, which upheld the use of student diversity as a compelling justification for affirmative action in higher education.\nColumbia has four official undergraduate colleges: Columbia College, the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree; the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering), the engineering and applied science school offering the Bachelor of Science degree; the School of General Studies, the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree to non-traditional students undertaking full- or part-time study; and Barnard College. Barnard College is a women's liberal arts college and an academic affiliate in which students receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University. Their degrees are signed by the presidents of Columbia University and Barnard College. Barnard students are also eligible to cross-register classes that are available through the Barnard Catalogue and alumnae can join the Columbia Alumni Association.\nJoint degree programs are available through Union Theological Seminary, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, as well as through the Juilliard School. Teachers College and Barnard College are official faculties of the university; both colleges' presidents are deans under the university governance structure. The Columbia University Senate includes faculty and student representatives from Teachers College and Barnard College who serve two-year terms; all senators are accorded full voting privileges regarding matters impacting the entire university. Teachers College is an affiliated, financially independent graduate school with their own board of trustees. Pursuant to an affiliation agreement, Columbia is given the authority to confer \"degrees and diplomas\" to the graduates of Teachers College. The degrees are signed by presidents of Teachers College and Columbia University in a manner analogous to the university's other graduate schools. Columbia's General Studies school also has joint undergraduate programs available through University College London, Sciences Po, City University of Hong Kong, Trinity College Dublin, and the Juilliard School.\nThe university also has several Columbia Global Centers, in Amman, Beijing, Istanbul, Mumbai, Nairobi, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, and Tunis.\nInternational partnerships.\nColumbia students can study abroad for a semester or a year at partner institutions such as Sciences Po, (EHESS), (ENS), Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne University, King's College London, London School of Economics, University College London and the University of Warwick. Select students can study at either the University of Oxford or the University of Cambridge for a year if approved by both Columbia and either Oxford or Cambridge. Columbia also has a dual MA program with the Aga Khan University in London.\nRankings.\nColumbia University is ranked 18th in the United States and seventh globally for 2022\u20132023 by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\". In the previous year, Columbia was ranked sixth in the United States, although this was later found to have partly resulted from inaccurate statistics submitted by the university, resulting in its temporary delisting from the rankings. QS University Rankings listed Columbia as fifth in the United States. Ranked 15th among U.S. colleges for 2020 by \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"Times Higher Education\", in recent years it has been ranked as high as second. Individual colleges and schools were also nationally ranked by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" for its 2021 edition. Columbia Law School was ranked fourth, the Mailman School of Public Health fourth, the School of Social Work tied for third, Columbia Business School eighth, the College of Physicians and Surgeons tied for sixth for research (and tied for 31st for primary care), the School of Nursing tied for 11th in the master's program and tied for first in the doctorate nursing program, and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (graduate) was ranked tied for 14th.\nIn 2021, Columbia was ranked seventh in the world (sixth in the United States) by \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\", sixth in the world by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\", 19th in the world by \"QS World University Rankings\", and 11th globally by \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\". It was ranked in the first tier of American research universities, along with Harvard, MIT, and Stanford, in the 2019 report from the Center for Measuring University Performance. In 2022, Columbia's reporting of metrics used for university ranking was criticized by Professor of Mathematics Michael Thaddeus, who argued key data supporting the ranking was \"inaccurate, dubious or highly misleading.\" Subsequently, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" \"unranked\" Columbia from its 2022 list of Best Colleges saying that it could not verify the data submitted by the university. In June 2023, Columbia University announced their undergraduate schools would no longer participate in \"U.S. News &amp; World Report's\" rankings, following the lead of its law, medical and nursing schools. A press release cited concerns that such rankings unduly influence applicants and \"distill a university\u2019s profile into a composite of data categories.\"\nColumbia's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation was ranked the second most admired graduate program by Architectural Record in 2020.\nIn 2015, Columbia University was ranked the first in the state by average professor salaries. In 2011, the ranked Columbia third best university for forming CEOs in the US and 12th worldwide.\nResearch.\nColumbia is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". Columbia was the first North American site where the uranium atom was split. The College of Physicians and Surgeons played a central role in developing the modern understanding of neuroscience with the publication of \"Principles of Neural Science\", described by historian of science Katja Huenther as the \"neuroscience 'bible' \". The book was written by a team of Columbia researchers that included Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, James H. Schwartz, and Thomas Jessell. Columbia was the birthplace of FM radio and the laser. The first brain-computer interface capable of translating brain signals into speech was developed by neuroengineers at Columbia. The MPEG-2 algorithm of transmitting high quality audio and video over limited bandwidth was developed by Dimitris Anastassiou, a Columbia professor of electrical engineering. Biologist Martin Chalfie was the first to introduce the use of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in labeling cells in intact organisms. Other inventions and products related to Columbia include Sequential Lateral Solidification (SLS) technology for making LCDs, System Management Arts (SMARTS), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (which is used for audio, video, chat, instant messaging and whiteboarding), pharmacopeia, Macromodel (software for computational chemistry), a new and better recipe for glass concrete, Blue LEDs, and Beamprop (used in photonics).\nColumbia scientists have been credited with about 175 new inventions in the health sciences each year. More than 30 pharmaceutical products based on discoveries and inventions made at Columbia reached the market. These include Remicade (for arthritis), Reopro (for blood clot complications), Xalatan (for glaucoma), Benefix, Latanoprost (a glaucoma treatment), shoulder prosthesis, homocysteine (testing for cardiovascular disease), and Zolinza (for cancer therapy). Columbia Technology Ventures (formerly Science and Technology Ventures), as of 2008[ [update]], manages some 600 patents and more than 250 active license agreements. Patent-related deals earned Columbia more than $230\u00a0million in the 2006 fiscal year, according to the university, more than any university in the world. Columbia owns many unique research facilities, such as the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information dedicated to telecommunications and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which is an astronomical observatory affiliated with NASA.\nMilitary and veteran enrollment.\nColumbia is a long-standing participant of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Yellow Ribbon Program, allowing eligible veterans to pursue a Columbia undergraduate degree regardless of socioeconomic status for over 70 years. As a part of the Eisenhower Leader Development Program (ELDP) in partnership with the United States Military Academy at West Point, Columbia is the only school in the Ivy League to offer a graduate degree program in organizational psychology to aid military officers in tactical decision making and strategic management.\nAwards.\nSeveral prestigious awards are administered by Columbia University, most notably the Pulitzer Prize and the Bancroft Prize in history. Other prizes, which are awarded by the Graduate School of Journalism, include the Alfred I. duPont\u2013Columbia University Award, the National Magazine Awards, the Maria Moors Cabot Prizes, the John Chancellor Award, and the Lukas Prizes, which include the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize and Mark Lynton History Prize. The university also administers the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize, which is considered an important precursor to the Nobel Prize, 51 of its 101 recipients having gone on to win either a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine or Nobel Prize in Chemistry as of October 2018; the W. Alden Spencer Award; the Vetlesen Prize, which is known as the Nobel Prize of geology; the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission Prize for the Translation of Japanese Literature, the oldest such award; the Edwin Howard Armstrong award; the Calderone Prize in public health; and the Ditson Conductor's Award.\nStudent life.\nStudents.\nIn 2020, Columbia University's student population was 31,455 (8,842 students in undergraduate programs and 22,613 in postgraduate programs), with 45% of the student population identifying themselves as a minority. Twenty-six percent of students at Columbia have family incomes below $60,000. 16% of students at Columbia receive Federal Pell Grants, which mostly go to students whose family incomes are below $40,000. Seventeen percent of students are the first member of their family to attend a four-year college.\nOn-campus housing is guaranteed for all four years as an undergraduate. Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) share housing in the on-campus residence halls. First-year students usually live in one of the large residence halls situated around South Lawn: Carman Hall, Furnald Hall, Hartley Hall, John Jay Hall, or Wallach Hall (originally Livingston Hall). Upperclassmen participate in a room selection process, wherein students can pick to live in a mix of either corridor- or apartment-style housing with their friends. The Columbia University School of General Studies, Barnard College and graduate schools have their own apartment-style housing in the surrounding neighborhood.\nColumbia University is home to many fraternities, sororities, and co-educational Greek organizations. Approximately 10\u201315% of undergraduate students are associated with Greek life. Many Barnard women also join Columbia sororities. There has been a Greek presence on campus since the establishment in 1836 of the Delta chapter of Alpha Delta Phi. The InterGreek Council is the self-governing student organization that provides guidelines and support to its member organizations within each of the three councils at Columbia, the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, and Multicultural Greek Council. The three council presidents bring their affiliated chapters together once a month to meet as one Greek community. The InterGreek Council meetings provide opportunity for member organizations to learn from each other, work together and advocate for community needs.\nPublications.\nThe \"Columbia Daily Spectator\" is the nation's second-oldest continuously operating daily student newspaper. \"The Blue and White\" is a monthly literary magazine established in 1890 that discusses campus life and local politics. \"Bwog\", originally an offshoot of \"The Blue and White\" but now fully independent, is an online campus news and entertainment source. \"The Morningside Post\" is a student-run multimedia news publication.\nPolitical publications include \"The Current\", a journal of politics, culture and Jewish Affairs; the \"Columbia Political Review\", the multi-partisan political magazine of the Columbia Political Union; and \"AdHoc\", which denotes itself as the \"progressive\" campus magazine and deals largely with local political issues and arts events.\n\"Columbia Magazine\" is the alumni magazine of Columbia, serving all 340,000+ of the university's alumni. Arts and literary publications include \"The Columbia Review\", the nation's oldest college literary magazine; \"Surgam\", the literary magazine of The Philolexian Society; \"Quarto\", Columbia University's official undergraduate literary magazine; \"4x4\", a student-run alternative to \"Quarto\"; \"Columbia\", a nationally regarded literary journal; the \"Columbia Journal of Literary Criticism\"; and \"The Mobius Strip\", an online arts and literary magazine. \"Inside New York\" is an annual guidebook to New York City, written, edited, and published by Columbia undergraduates. Through a distribution agreement with Columbia University Press, the book is sold at major retailers and independent bookstores.\nColumbia is home to numerous undergraduate academic publications. The \"Columbia Undergraduate Science Journal\" prints original science research in its two annual publications. The \"Journal of Politics &amp; Society\" is a journal of undergraduate research in the social sciences; \"Publius\" is an undergraduate journal of politics established in 2008 and published biannually; the \"Columbia East Asia Review\" allows undergraduates throughout the world to publish original work on China, Japan, Korea, Tibet, and Vietnam and is supported by the Weatherhead East Asian Institute; \"The Birch\" is an undergraduate journal of Eastern European and Eurasian culture that is the first national student-run journal of its kind; the \"Columbia Economics Review\" is the undergraduate economic journal on research and policy supported by the Columbia Economics Department; and the \"Columbia Science Review\" is a science magazine that prints general interest articles and faculty profiles.\nHumor publications on Columbia's campus include \"The Fed\", a triweekly satire and investigative newspaper, and the \"Jester of Columbia.\" Other publications include \"The Columbian\", the undergraduate colleges' annually published yearbook; the \"Gadfly\", a biannual journal of popular philosophy produced by undergraduates; and \"Rhapsody in Blue\", an undergraduate urban studies magazine. Professional journals published by academic departments at Columbia University include \"Current Musicology\" and \"The Journal of Philosophy\". During the spring semester, graduate students in the Journalism School publish \"The Bronx Beat\", a bi-weekly newspaper covering the South Bronx.\nFounded in 1961 under the auspices of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" (CJR) examines day-to-day press performance as well as the forces that affect that performance. The magazine is published six times a year.\nBroadcasting.\nColumbia is home to two pioneers in undergraduate campus radio broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. Many undergraduates are also involved with Barnard's radio station, WBAR. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-state area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with Major Edwin Armstrong. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR was not a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room. The station has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest student television station and the home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.\nDebate and Model UN.\nThe Philolexian Society is a literary and debating club founded in 1802, making it the oldest student group at Columbia, as well as the third oldest collegiate literary society in the country. The society annually administers the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Bad Poetry Contest. The Columbia Parliamentary Debate Team competes in tournaments around the country as part of the American Parliamentary Debate Association, and hosts both high school and college tournaments on Columbia's campus, as well as public debates on issues affecting the university.\nThe Columbia International Relations Council and Association (CIRCA), oversees Columbia's Model United Nations activities. CIRCA hosts college and high school Model UN conferences, hosts speakers influential in international politics to speak on campus, and trains students from underprivileged schools in New York in Model UN.\nTechnology and entrepreneurship.\nColumbia is a top supplier of young engineering entrepreneurs for New York City. Over the past 20 years, graduates of Columbia established over 100 technology companies.\nThe Columbia University Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs (CORE) was founded in 1999. The student-run group aims to foster entrepreneurship on campus. Each year CORE hosts dozens of events, including talks, #StartupColumbia, a conference and venture competition for $250,000, and Ignite@CU, a weekend for undergrads interested in design, engineering, and entrepreneurship. Notable speakers include Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, Alexis Ohanian, Drew Houston, and Mark Cuban. As of 2006, CORE had awarded graduate and undergraduate students over $100,000 in seed capital.\nCampusNetwork, an on-campus social networking site called Campus Network that preceded Facebook, was created and popularized by Columbia engineering student Adam Goldberg in 2003. Mark Zuckerberg later asked Goldberg to join him in Palo Alto to work on Facebook, but Goldberg declined the offer. The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science offers a minor in Technical Entrepreneurship through its Center for Technology, Innovation, and Community Engagement. SEAS' entrepreneurship activities focus on community building initiatives in New York and worldwide, made possible through partners such as Microsoft Corporation.\nOn June 14, 2010, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg launched the NYC Media Lab to promote innovations in New York's media industry. Situated at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, the lab is a consortium of Columbia University, New York University, and New York City Economic Development Corporation acting to connect companies with universities in new technology research. The Lab is modeled after similar ones at MIT and Stanford, and was established with a $250,000 grant from the New York City Economic Development Corporation.\nAthletics.\nA member institution of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in Division I FCS, Columbia fields varsity teams in 29 sports and is a member of the Ivy League. The football Lions play home games at the 17,000-seat Robert K. Kraft Field at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium. The Baker Athletics Complex also includes facilities for baseball, softball, soccer, lacrosse, field hockey, tennis, track, and rowing, as well as the new Campbell Sports Center, which opened in January 2013. The basketball, fencing, swimming &amp; diving, volleyball, and wrestling programs are based at the Dodge Physical Fitness Center on the main campus.\nFormer students include Baseball Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig and Eddie Collins, football Hall of Famer Sid Luckman, Marcellus Wiley, and world champion women's weightlifter Karyn Marshall. On May 17, 1939, fledgling NBC broadcast a doubleheader between the Columbia Lions and the Princeton Tigers at Columbia's Baker Field, making it the first televised regular athletic event in history.\nColumbia University athletics has a long history, with many accomplishments in athletic fields. In 1870, Columbia played against Rutgers University in the second intercollegiate rugby football game in the history of the sport. Eight years later, Columbia crew won the famed Henley Royal Regatta in the first-ever defeat for an English crew rowing in English waters. In 1900, Olympian and Columbia College student Maxie Long set the first official world record in the 400 meters with a time of 47.8 seconds. In 1983, Columbia men's soccer went 18\u20130 and was ranked first in the nation, but lost to Indiana 1\u20130 in double overtime in the NCAA championship game; nevertheless, the team went further toward the NCAA title than any Ivy League soccer team in history. The football program unfortunately is best known for its record of futility set during the 1980s: between 1983 and 1988, the team lost 44 games in a row, which is still the record for the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision. The streak was broken on October 8, 1988, with a 16\u201313 victory over arch-rival Princeton University. That was the Lions' first victory at Wien Stadium, which had been opened during the losing streak and was already four years old. A new tradition has developed with the Liberty Cup. The Liberty Cup is awarded annually to the winner of the football game between Fordham and Columbia Universities, two of the only three NCAA Division I football teams in New York City.\nWorld Leaders Forum.\nEstablished in 2003 by university president Lee C. Bollinger, the World Leaders Forum at Columbia University provides the opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students alike to listen to world leaders in government, religion, industry, finance, and academia. The World Leaders Forum is a year-around event series that strives to provide a platform for uninhibited speech among nations and cultures, while educating students about problems and progress around the globe.\nPast forum speakers include former president of the United States Bill Clinton, the prime minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former president of Ghana John Agyekum Kufuor, president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai, prime minister of Russia Vladimir Putin, president of the Republic of Mozambique Joaquim Alberto Chissano, president of the Republic of Bolivia Carlos Diego Mesa Gisbert, president of the Republic of Romania Ion Iliescu, president of the Republic of Latvia Vaira V\u012b\u0137e-Freiberga, the first female president of Finland Tarja Halonen, President Yudhoyono of Indonesia, President Pervez Musharraf of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, Iraq President Jalal Talabani, the 14th Dalai Lama, president of the Islamic Republic of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, financier George Soros, Mayor of New York City Michael R. Bloomberg, President V\u00e1clav Klaus of the Czech Republic, President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner of Argentina, former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, and Al Gore.\nOther.\nThe Columbia University Orchestra was founded by composer Edward MacDowell in 1896, and is the oldest continually operating university orchestra in the United States. Undergraduate student composers at Columbia may choose to become involved with Columbia New Music, which sponsors concerts of music written by undergraduate students from all of Columbia's schools. The Notes and Keys, the oldest a cappella group at Columbia, was founded in 1909. There are a number of performing arts groups at Columbia dedicated to producing student theater, including the Columbia Players, King's Crown Shakespeare Troupe (KCST), Columbia Musical Theater Society (CMTS), NOMADS (New and Original Material Authored and Directed by Students), LateNite Theatre, Columbia University Performing Arts League (CUPAL), Black Theatre Ensemble (BTE), sketch comedy group Chowdah, and improvisational troupes Alfred and Fruit Paunch.\nThe Columbia Queer Alliance is the central Columbia student organization that represents the bisexual, lesbian, gay, transgender, and questioning student population. It is the oldest gay student organization in the world, founded as the Student Homophile League in 1967 by students including lifelong activist Stephen Donaldson.\nColumbia University campus military groups include the U.S. Military Veterans of Columbia University and Advocates for Columbia ROTC. In the 2005\u201306 academic year, the Columbia Military Society, Columbia's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates, was renamed the Hamilton Society for \"students who aspire to serve their nation through the military in the tradition of Alexander Hamilton\".\nThe largest student service organization at Columbia is Community Impact (CI). Founded in 1981, CI provides food, clothing, shelter, education, job training, and companionship for residents in its surrounding communities. CI consists of about 950 Columbia University student volunteers participating in 25 community service programs, which serve more than 8,000 people each year.\nColumbia has several secret societies, including St. Anthony Hall, which was founded at the university in 1847, and two senior societies, the Nacoms and Sachems.\nTraditions.\nOrgo Night.\nIn one of the school's longest-lasting traditions, begun in 1975, at midnight before the Organic Chemistry exam\u2014often the first day of final exams\u2014the Columbia University Marching Band invaded and briefly occupied the main undergraduate reading room in Butler Library to distract and entertain studying students with some forty-five minutes of raucous jokes and music, beginning and ending with the singing of the school's fight song, \"Roar, Lion, Roar\". After the main show before a crowd that routinely began filling the room well before the announced midnight start time, the Band led a procession to several campus locations, including the residential quadrangle of Barnard College for more music and temporary relief from the stress of last-minute studying.\nIn December 2016, following several years of complaints from students who said that some Orgo Night scripts and advertising posters were offensive to minority groups, as well as a \"New York Times\" article on the Band's crass treatment of sexual assault on campus, University administrators banned the Marching Band from performing its Orgo Night show in the traditional Butler Library location. Protests and allegations of censorship followed, but University President Lee Bollinger said that complaints and publicity about the shows had \"nothing to do with\" the prohibition. The Band instead performed\u2014at midnight, as usual\u2014outside the main entrance of Butler Library.\nThe Band's official alumni organization, the Columbia University Band Alumni Association, registered protests with the administration, and an ad hoc group of alumni writing under the name \"A. Hamiltonius\" published a series of pamphlets addressing their dissatisfaction with the ban, but at the end of the spring 2017 semester the university administration held firm, prompting the Marching Band to again stage its show outside the building. For Orgo Night December 2017, Band members quietly infiltrated the library with their musical instruments during the evening and popped up at midnight to perform the show inside despite the ban. Prior to the spring 2018 exam period, the administration warned the group's leaders against a repeat and restated the injunction, warning of sanctions; the Band again staged its Orgo Night show in front of the library.\nTree Lighting and Yule Log ceremonies.\nThe campus Tree Lighting ceremony was inaugurated in 1998. It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of Kent Hall and Hamilton Hall on the east end and Dodge Hall and Pulitzer Hall on the west, just before finals week in early December. The lights remain on until February 28. Students meet at the sundial for free hot chocolate, performances by \"a cappella\" groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.\nImmediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the American Revolutionary War, but lapsed before being revived by President Nicholas Murray Butler in 1910. A troop of students dressed as Continental Army soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sundial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony is accompanied by a reading of \"A Visit From St. Nicholas\" by Clement Clarke Moore and \"Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus\" by Francis Pharcellus Church.\nThe Varsity Show.\nThe Varsity Show is an annual musical written by and for students and was established in 1894, making it one of Columbia's oldest traditions. Past writers and directors have included Columbians Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, Lorenz Hart, I.A.L. Diamond, Herman Wouk and Eric Garcetti. The show has one of the largest operating budgets of all university events.\nNotable people.\nAlumni.\nThe university has graduated many notable alumni, including five Founding Fathers of the United States, an author of the United States Constitution and a member of the Committee of Five. Three United States presidents have attended Columbia, as well as ten Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, including three Chief Justices. As of 2011[ [update]], 125 Pulitzer Prize winners and 39 Oscar winners have attended Columbia.

In total, the Columbia faculty has included 52 Nobel laureates, 12 National Medal of Science recipients, and 32 National Academy of Engineering members.\nColumbia University faculty played particularly important roles during World War II and the creation of the New Deal under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who attended Columbia Law School. The three core members of Roosevelt's Brain Trust: Adolf A. Berle, Raymond Moley, and Rexford Tugwell, were law professors at Columbia. The Statistical Research Group, which used statistics to analyze military problems during World War II, was composed of Columbia researchers and faculty including George Stigler and Milton Friedman. Columbia faculty and researchers, including Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, Eugene T. Booth, John R. Dunning, George B. Pegram, Walter Zinn, Chien-Shiung Wu, Francis G. Slack, Harold Urey, Herbert L. Anderson, and Isidor Isaac Rabi, also played a significant role during the early phases of the Manhattan Project.\nFollowing the rise of Nazi Germany, the exiled Institute for Social Research at Goethe University Frankfurt would affiliate itself with Columbia from 1934 to 1950. It was during this period that thinkers including Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse wrote and published some of the most seminal works of the Frankfurt School, including \"Reason and Revolution\", \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\", and \"Eclipse of Reason\". Professors Edward Said, author of \"Orientalism\", and Gayatri Spivak are generally considered as founders of the field of postcolonialism; other professors that have significantly contributed to the field include Hamid Dabashi and Joseph Massad.

{"id": "6312", "revid": "45382375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6312", "title": "Cell wall", "text": "Outermost layer of some cells\nA cell wall is a structural layer surrounding some types of cells, just outside the cell membrane. It can be tough, flexible, and sometimes rigid. It provides the cell with both structural support and protection, and also acts as a filtering mechanism. Cell walls are absent in many eukaryotes, including animals, but are present in some other ones like fungi, algae and plants, and in most prokaryotes (except mollicute bacteria). A major function is to act as pressure vessels, preventing over-expansion of the cell when water enters.\nThe composition of cell walls varies between taxonomic group and species and may depend on cell type and developmental stage. The primary cell wall of land plants is composed of the polysaccharides cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectin. Often, other polymers such as lignin, suberin or cutin are anchored to or embedded in plant cell walls. Algae possess cell walls made of glycoproteins and polysaccharides such as carrageenan and agar that are absent from land plants. In bacteria, the cell wall is composed of peptidoglycan. The cell walls of archaea have various compositions, and may be formed of glycoprotein S-layers, pseudopeptidoglycan, or polysaccharides. Fungi possess cell walls made of the N-acetylglucosamine polymer chitin. Unusually, diatoms have a cell wall composed of biogenic silica.\nHistory.\nA plant cell wall was first observed and named (simply as a \"wall\") by Robert Hooke in 1665. However, \"the dead excrusion product of the living protoplast\" was forgotten, for almost three centuries, being the subject of scientific interest mainly as a resource for industrial processing or in relation to animal or human health.\nIn 1804, Karl Rudolphi and J.H.F. Link proved that cells had independent cell walls. Before, it had been thought that cells shared walls and that fluid passed between them this way.\nThe mode of formation of the cell wall was controversial in the 19th century. Hugo von Mohl (1853, 1858) advocated the idea that the cell wall grows by apposition. Carl N\u00e4geli (1858, 1862, 1863) believed that the growth of the wall in thickness and in area was due to a process termed intussusception. Each theory was improved in the following decades: the apposition (or lamination) theory by Eduard Strasburger (1882, 1889), and the intussusception theory by Julius Wiesner (1886).\nIn 1930, Ernst M\u00fcnch coined the term \"apoplast\" in order to separate the \"living\" symplast from the \"dead\" plant region, the latter of which included the cell wall.\nBy the 1980s, some authors suggested replacing the term \"cell wall\", particularly as it was used for plants, with the more precise term \"extracellular matrix\", as used for animal cells, but others preferred the older term.\nProperties.\nCell walls serve similar purposes in those organisms that possess them. They may give cells rigidity and strength, offering protection against mechanical stress. The chemical composition and mechanical properties of the cell wall are linked with plant cell growth and morphogenesis. In multicellular organisms, they permit the organism to build and hold a definite shape. Cell walls also limit the entry of large molecules that may be toxic to the cell. They further permit the creation of stable osmotic environments by preventing osmotic lysis and helping to retain water. Their composition, properties, and form may change during the cell cycle and depend on growth conditions.\nRigidity of cell walls.\nIn most cells, the cell wall is flexible, meaning that it will bend rather than holding a fixed shape, but has considerable tensile strength. The apparent rigidity of primary plant tissues is enabled by cell walls, but is not due to the walls' stiffness. Hydraulic turgor pressure creates this rigidity, along with the wall structure. The flexibility of the cell walls is seen when plants wilt, so that the stems and leaves begin to droop, or in seaweeds that bend in water currents. As John Howland explains\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe apparent rigidity of the cell wall thus results from inflation of the cell contained within. This inflation is a result of the passive uptake of water.\nIn plants, a secondary cell wall is a thicker additional layer of cellulose which increases wall rigidity. Additional layers may be formed by lignin in xylem cell walls, or suberin in cork cell walls. These compounds are rigid and waterproof, making the secondary wall stiff. Both wood and bark cells of trees have secondary walls. Other parts of plants such as the leaf stalk may acquire similar reinforcement to resist the strain of physical forces.\nPermeability.\nThe primary cell wall of most plant cells is freely permeable to small molecules including small proteins, with size exclusion estimated to be 30-60 kDa. The pH is an important factor governing the transport of molecules through cell walls.\nEvolution.\nCell walls evolved independently in many groups.\nThe photosynthetic eukaryotes (so-called plant and algae) is one group with cellulose cell walls, where the cell wall is closely related to the evolution of multicellularity, terrestrialization and vascularization. The CesA cellulose synthase evolved in \"Cyanobacteria\" and was part of Archaeplastida since endosymbiosis; secondary endosymbiosis events transferred it (with the arabinogalactan proteins) further into brown algae and oomycetes. Plants later evolved various genes from CesA, including the Csl (cellulose synthase-like) family of proteins and additional Ces proteins. Combined with the various glycosyltransferases (GT), they enable more complex chemical structures to be built.\nFungi use a chitin-glucan-protein cell wall. They share the 1,3-\u03b2-glucan synthesis pathway with plants, using homologous GT48 family 1,3-Beta-glucan synthases to perform the task, suggesting that such an enzyme is very ancient within the eukaryotes. Their glycoproteins are rich in mannose. The cell wall might have evolved to deter viral infections. Proteins embedded in cell walls are variable, contained in tandem repeats subject to homologous recombination. An alternative scenario is that fungi started with a chitin-based cell wall and later acquired the GT-48 enzymes for the 1,3-\u03b2-glucans via horizontal gene transfer. The pathway leading to 1,6-\u03b2-glucan synthesis is not sufficiently known in either case.\nPlant cell walls.\nThe walls of plant cells must have sufficient tensile strength to withstand internal osmotic pressures of several times atmospheric pressure that result from the difference in solute concentration between the cell interior and external solutions. Plant cell walls vary from 0.1 to several \u00b5m in thickness.\nLayers.\nUp to three strata or layers may be found in plant cell walls:\nComposition.\nIn the primary (growing) plant cell wall, the major carbohydrates are cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. The cellulose microfibrils are linked via hemicellulosic tethers to form the cellulose-hemicellulose network, which is embedded in the pectin matrix. The most common hemicellulose in the primary cell wall is xyloglucan. In grass cell walls, xyloglucan and pectin are reduced in abundance and partially replaced by glucuronoarabinoxylan, another type of hemicellulose. Primary cell walls characteristically extend (grow) by a mechanism called acid growth, mediated by expansins, extracellular proteins activated by acidic conditions that modify the hydrogen bonds between pectin and cellulose. This functions to increase cell wall extensibility. The outer part of the primary cell wall of the plant epidermis is usually impregnated with cutin and wax, forming a permeability barrier known as the plant cuticle.\nSecondary cell walls contain a wide range of additional compounds that modify their mechanical properties and permeability. The major polymers that make up wood (largely secondary cell walls) include:\nAdditionally, structural proteins (1-5%) are found in most plant cell walls; they are classified as hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP), arabinogalactan proteins (AGP), glycine-rich proteins (GRPs), and proline-rich proteins (PRPs). Each class of glycoprotein is defined by a characteristic, highly repetitive protein sequence. Most are glycosylated, contain hydroxyproline (Hyp) and become cross-linked in the cell wall. These proteins are often concentrated in specialized cells and in cell corners. Cell walls of the epidermis may contain cutin. The Casparian strip in the endodermis roots and cork cells of plant bark contain suberin. Both cutin and suberin are polyesters that function as permeability barriers to the movement of water. The relative composition of carbohydrates, secondary compounds and proteins varies between plants and between the cell type and age. Plant cells walls also contain numerous enzymes, such as hydrolases, esterases, peroxidases, and transglycosylases, that cut, trim and cross-link wall polymers.\nSecondary walls - especially in grasses - may also contain microscopic silica crystals, which may strengthen the wall and protect it from herbivores.\nCell walls in some plant tissues also function as storage deposits for carbohydrates that can be broken down and resorbed to supply the metabolic and growth needs of the plant. For example, endosperm cell walls in the seeds of cereal grasses, nasturtium\nand other species, are rich in glucans and other polysaccharides that are readily digested by enzymes during seed germination to form simple sugars that nourish the growing embryo.\nFormation.\nThe middle lamella is laid down first, formed from the cell plate during cytokinesis, and the primary cell wall is then deposited inside the middle lamella. The actual structure of the cell wall is not clearly defined and several models exist - the covalently linked cross model, the tether model, the diffuse layer model and the stratified layer model. However, the primary cell wall, can be defined as composed of cellulose microfibrils aligned at all angles. Cellulose microfibrils are produced at the plasma membrane by the cellulose synthase complex, which is proposed to be made of a hexameric rosette that contains three cellulose synthase catalytic subunits for each of the six units. Microfibrils are held together by hydrogen bonds to provide a high tensile strength. The cells are held together and share the gelatinous membrane called the \"middle lamella\", which contains magnesium and calcium pectates (salts of pectic acid). Cells interact though plasmodesmata, which are inter-connecting channels of cytoplasm that connect to the protoplasts of adjacent cells across the cell wall.\nIn some plants and cell types, after a maximum size or point in development has been reached, a \"secondary wall\" is constructed between the plasma membrane and primary wall. Unlike the primary wall, the cellulose microfibrils are aligned parallel in layers, the orientation changing slightly with each additional layer so that the structure becomes helicoidal. Cells with secondary cell walls can be rigid, as in the gritty sclereid cells in pear and quince fruit. Cell to cell communication is possible through pits in the secondary cell wall that allow plasmodesmata to connect cells through the secondary cell walls.\nFungal cell walls.\nThere are several groups of organisms that have been called \"fungi\". Some of these groups (Oomycete and Myxogastria) have been transferred out of the Kingdom Fungi, in part because of fundamental biochemical differences in the composition of the cell wall. Most true fungi have a cell wall consisting largely of chitin and other polysaccharides. True fungi do not have cellulose in their cell walls.\nTrue fungi.\nIn fungi, the cell wall is the outer-most layer, external to the plasma membrane. The fungal cell wall is a matrix of three main components:\nOther eukaryotic cell walls.\nAlgae.\nLike plants, algae have cell walls. Algal cell walls contain either polysaccharides (such as cellulose (a glucan)) or a variety of glycoproteins (Volvocales) or both. The inclusion of additional polysaccharides in algal cells walls is used as a feature for algal taxonomy.\nOther compounds that may accumulate in algal cell walls include sporopollenin and calcium ions.\nThe group of algae known as the diatoms synthesize their cell walls (also known as frustules or valves) from silicic acid. Significantly, relative to the organic cell walls produced by other groups, silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8%), potentially a major saving on the overall cell energy budget and possibly an explanation for higher growth rates in diatoms.\nIn brown algae, phlorotannins may be a constituent of the cell walls.\nWater molds.\nThe group Oomycetes, also known as water molds, are saprotrophic plant pathogens like fungi. Until recently they were widely believed to be fungi, but structural and molecular evidence has led to their reclassification as heterokonts, related to autotrophic brown algae and diatoms. Unlike fungi, oomycetes typically possess cell walls of cellulose and glucans rather than chitin, although some genera (such as \"Achlya\" and \"Saprolegnia\") do have chitin in their walls. The fraction of cellulose in the walls is no more than 4 to 20%, far less than the fraction of glucans. Oomycete cell walls also contain the amino acid hydroxyproline, which is not found in fungal cell walls.\nSlime molds.\nThe dictyostelids are another group formerly classified among the fungi. They are slime molds that feed as unicellular amoebae, but aggregate into a reproductive stalk and sporangium under certain conditions. Cells of the reproductive stalk, as well as the spores formed at the apex, possess a cellulose wall. The spore wall has three layers, the middle one composed primarily of cellulose, while the innermost is sensitive to cellulase and pronase.\nProkaryotic cell walls.\nBacterial cell walls.\nAround the outside of the cell membrane is the bacterial cell wall. Bacterial cell walls are made of peptidoglycan (also called murein), which is made from polysaccharide chains cross-linked by unusual peptides containing D-amino acids. Bacterial cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi which are made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of Archaea, which do not contain peptidoglycan. The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria, although L-form bacteria can be produced in the laboratory that lack a cell wall. The antibiotic penicillin is able to kill bacteria by preventing the cross-linking of peptidoglycan and this causes the cell wall to weaken and lyse. The lysozyme enzyme can also damage bacterial cell walls.\nThere are broadly speaking two different types of cell wall in bacteria, called gram-positive and gram-negative. The names originate from the reaction of cells to the Gram stain, a test long-employed for the classification of bacterial species.\nGram-positive bacteria possess a thick cell wall containing many layers of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall and only the Bacillota and Actinomycetota (previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria, respectively) have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility, for instance vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as \"Haemophilus influenzae\" or \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\".\nArchaeal cell walls.\nAlthough not truly unique, the cell walls of Archaea are unusual. Whereas peptidoglycan is a standard component of all bacterial cell walls, all archaeal cell walls lack peptidoglycan, though some methanogens have a cell wall made of a similar polymer called pseudopeptidoglycan. There are four types of cell wall currently known among the Archaea.\nOne type of archaeal cell wall is that composed of pseudopeptidoglycan (also called pseudomurein). This type of wall is found in some methanogens, such as \"Methanobacterium\" and \"Methanothermus\". While the overall structure of archaeal \"pseudo\"peptidoglycan superficially resembles that of bacterial peptidoglycan, there are a number of significant chemical differences. Like the peptidoglycan found in bacterial cell walls, pseudopeptidoglycan consists of polymer chains of glycan cross-linked by short peptide connections. However, unlike peptidoglycan, the sugar N-acetylmuramic acid is replaced by N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid, and the two sugars are bonded with a \"\u03b2\",1-3 glycosidic linkage instead of \"\u03b2\",1-4. Additionally, the cross-linking peptides are L-amino acids rather than D-amino acids as they are in bacteria.\nA second type of archaeal cell wall is found in \"Methanosarcina\" and \"Halococcus\". This type of cell wall is composed entirely of a thick layer of polysaccharides, which may be sulfated in the case of \"Halococcus\". Structure in this type of wall is complex and not fully investigated.\nA third type of wall among the Archaea consists of glycoprotein, and occurs in the hyperthermophiles, \"Halobacterium\", and some methanogens. In \"Halobacterium\", the proteins in the wall have a high content of acidic amino acids, giving the wall an overall negative charge. The result is an unstable structure that is stabilized by the presence of large quantities of positive sodium ions that neutralize the charge. Consequently, \"Halobacterium\" thrives only under conditions with high salinity.\nIn other Archaea, such as \"Methanomicrobium\" and \"Desulfurococcus\", the wall may be composed only of surface-layer proteins, known as an \"S-layer\". S-layers are common in bacteria, where they serve as either the sole cell-wall component or an outer layer in conjunction with polysaccharides. Most Archaea are Gram-negative, though at least one Gram-positive member is known.\nOther cell coverings.\nMany protists and bacteria produce other cell surface structures apart from cell walls, external (extracellular matrix) or internal. Many algae have a sheath or envelope of mucilage outside the cell made of exopolysaccharides. Diatoms build a frustule from silica extracted from the surrounding water; radiolarians, foraminiferans, testate amoebae and silicoflagellates also produce a skeleton from minerals, called test in some groups. Many green algae, such as \"Halimeda\" and the Dasycladales, and some red algae, the Corallinales, encase their cells in a secreted skeleton of calcium carbonate. In each case, the wall is rigid and essentially inorganic. It is the non-living component of cell. Some golden algae, ciliates and choanoflagellates produces a shell-like protective outer covering called lorica. Some dinoflagellates have a theca of cellulose plates, and coccolithophorids have coccoliths.\nAn extracellular matrix (ECM) is also present in metazoans. Its composition varies between cells, but collagens are the most abundant protein in the ECM.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ancient cultures in Greece, Tibet, and India had similar lists which sometimes referred, in local languages, to \"air\" as \"wind\" and the fifth element as \"void\".\nThese different cultures and even individual philosophers had widely varying explanations concerning their attributes and how they related to observable phenomena as well as cosmology. Sometimes these theories overlapped with mythology and were personified in deities. Some of these interpretations included atomism (the idea of very small, indivisible portions of matter), but other interpretations considered the elements to be divisible into infinitely small pieces without changing their nature.\nWhile the classification of the material world in ancient Indian, Hellenistic Egypt, and ancient Greece into air, earth, fire, and water was more philosophical, during the Middle Ages medieval scientists used practical, experimental observation to classify materials. In Europe, the ancient Greek concept, devised by Empedocles, evolved into the system of Aristotle and Hippocrates, who introduced systematic classification into the area, which evolved slightly into the medieval system, which for the first time in Europe became subject to experimental verification in the 1600s, during the Scientific Revolution.\nModern science does not support the classical elements as the material basis of the physical world. Atomic theory classifies atoms into more than a hundred chemical elements such as oxygen, iron, and mercury. These elements form chemical compounds and mixtures, and under different temperatures and pressures, these substances can adopt different states of matter. The most commonly observed states of solid, liquid, gas, and plasma share many attributes with the classical elements of earth, water, air, and fire, respectively, but these states are due to similar behavior of different types of atoms at similar energy levels, and not due to containing a certain type of atom or substance.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHellenistic philosophy.\nThe ancient Greek concept of four basic elements, these being earth ( ), water ( ), air ( ), and fire ( ), dates from pre-Socratic times and persisted throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, deeply influencing European thought and culture.\nPre-Socratic elements.\nThe classical elements were first proposed independently by several early Presocratic philosophers. The Sicilian Greek philosopher Empedocles (c.\u2009450 BC) proved (at least to his satisfaction) that air was a separate substance by observing that a bucket inverted in water did not become filled with water, a pocket of air remaining trapped inside. Prior to Empedocles, Greek philosophers had debated which substance was the \"arche\" (\"first principle\"), or primordial element from which everything else was made; Heraclitus championed fire, Thales supported water, and Anaximenes favored air. Anaximander argued that the primordial substance was not any of the known substances, but could be transformed into them, and they into each other. Empedocles was the first to propose the four classical elements as a set: fire, earth, air, and water. He called them the four \"roots\" (, ).\nPlato.\nPlato seems to have been the first to use the term \"element (, )\" in reference to air, fire, earth, and water. The ancient Greek word for element, (from , \"to line up\") meant \"smallest division (of a sun-dial), a syllable\", as the composing unit of an alphabet it could denote a letter and the smallest unit from which a word is formed.\nHumorism.\nAccording to Galen, these elements were used by Hippocrates in describing the human body with an association with the four humours: yellow bile (fire), black bile (earth), blood (air), and phlegm (water). Medical care was primarily about helping the patient stay in or return to their own personal natural balanced state.\nAristotle.\nIn \"On the Heavens\", Aristotle defines \"element\" in general:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;An element, we take it, is a body into which other bodies may be analysed, present in them potentially or in actuality (which of these, is still disputable), and not itself divisible into bodies different in form. That, or something like it, is what all men in every case mean by element.\nIn his \"On Generation and Corruption\", Aristotle related each of the four elements to two of the four sensible qualities:\nA classic diagram has one square inscribed in the other, with the corners of one being the classical elements, and the corners of the other being the properties. The opposite corner is the opposite of these properties, \"hot\u202f\u2013\u202fcold\" and \"dry\u202f\u2013\u202fwet\".\nAristotle added a fifth element, aether ( ), as the quintessence, reasoning that whereas fire, earth, air, and water were earthly and corruptible, since no changes had been perceived in the heavenly regions, the stars cannot be made out of any of the four elements but must be made of a different, unchangeable, heavenly substance. It had previously been believed by pre-Socratics such as Empedocles and Anaxagoras that aether, the name applied to the material of heavenly bodies, was a form of fire. Aristotle himself did not use the term \"aether\" for the fifth element, and strongly criticised the pre-Socratics for associating the term with fire. He preferred a number of other terms indicating eternal movement, thus emphasising the evidence for his discovery of a new element. These five elements have been associated since Plato's \"Timaeus\" with the five platonic solids.\nNeo-Platonism.\nThe Neoplatonic philosopher Proclus rejected Aristotle's theory relating the elements to the sensible qualities hot, cold, wet, and dry. He maintained that each of the elements has three properties. Fire is sharp, subtle, and mobile while its opposite, earth, is blunt, dense, and immobile; they are joined by the intermediate elements, air and water, in the following fashion:\nHermeticism.\nA text written in Egypt in Hellenistic or Roman times called the \"Kore Kosmou\" (\"Virgin of the World\") ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus (associated with the Egyptian god Thoth), names the four elements fire, water, air, and earth. As described in this book:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And Isis answer made: Of living things, my son, some are made friends with \"fire\", and some with \"water\", some with \"air\", and some with \"earth\", and some with two or three of these, and some with all. And, on the contrary, again some are made enemies of fire, and some of water, some of earth, and some of air, and some of two of them, and some of three, and some of all. For instance, son, the locust and all flies flee fire; the eagle and the hawk and all high-flying birds flee water; fish, air and earth; the snake avoids the open air. Whereas snakes and all creeping things love earth; all swimming things love water; winged things, air, of which they are the citizens; while those that fly still higher love the fire and have the habitat near it. Not that some of the animals as well do not love fire; for instance salamanders, for they even have their homes in it. It is because one or another of the elements doth form their bodies\u2019 outer envelope. Each soul, accordingly, while it is in its body is weighted and constricted by these four.\nAncient Indian philosophy.\nHinduism.\nThe system of five elements are found in Vedas, especially Ayurveda, the \"pancha mahabhuta\", or \"five great elements\", of Hinduism are:\nThey further suggest that all of creation, including the human body, is made of these five essential elements and that upon death, the human body dissolves into these five elements of nature, thereby balancing the cycle of nature.\nThe five elements are associated with the five senses, and act as the gross medium for the experience of sensations. The basest element, earth, created using all the other elements, can be perceived by all five senses\u202f\u2014\u202f(i) hearing, (ii) touch, (iii) sight, (iv) taste, and (v) smell. The next higher element, water, has no odor but can be heard, felt, seen and tasted. Next comes fire, which can be heard, felt and seen. Air can be heard and felt. \"Akasha\" (aether) is beyond the senses of smell, taste, sight, and touch; it being accessible to the sense of hearing alone.\nBuddhism.\nBuddhism has had a variety of thought about the five elements and their existence and relevance, some of which continue to this day.\nIn the Pali literature, the \"mahabhuta\" (\"great elements\") or \"catudhatu\" (\"four elements\") are earth, water, fire and air. In early Buddhism, the four elements are a basis for understanding suffering and for liberating oneself from suffering. The earliest Buddhist texts explain that the four primary material elements are solidity, fluidity, temperature, and mobility, characterized as earth, water, fire, and air, respectively.\nThe Buddha's teaching regarding the four elements is to be understood as the base of all observation of real sensations rather than as a philosophy. The four properties are cohesion (water), solidity or inertia (earth), expansion or vibration (air) and heat or energy content (fire). He promulgated a categorization of mind and matter as composed of eight types of \"kalapas\" of which the four elements are primary and a secondary group of four are colour, smell, taste, and nutriment which are derivative from the four primaries.\nThanissaro Bhikkhu (1997) renders an extract of Shakyamuni Buddha\u2019s from Pali into English thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice, having killed a cow, would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into pieces, the monk contemplates this very body\u200a\u2014\u200ahowever it stands, however it is disposed\u200a\u2014\u200ain terms of properties: \u2018In this body there is the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, &amp; the wind property.\u2019\nTibetan Buddhist medical literature speaks of the (five elements) or \"elemental properties\": earth, water, fire, wind, and space. The concept was extensively used in traditional Tibetan medicine. Tibetan Buddhist theology, tantra traditions, and \"astrological texts\" also spoke of them making up the \"environment, [human] bodies,\" and at the smallest or \"subtlest\" level of existence, parts of thought and the mind. Also at the subtlest level of existence, the elements exist as \"pure natures represented by the five female buddhas\", \u0100k\u0101\u015badh\u0101tvi\u015bvar\u012b, Buddhalocan\u0101, Mamak\u012b, P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dar\u0101vasin\u012b, and Samayat\u0101r\u0101, and these pure natures \"manifest as the physical properties of earth (solidity), water (fluidity), fire (heat and light), wind (movement and energy), and\" the expanse of space. These natures exist as all \"qualities\" that are in the physical world and take forms in it.\nPost-classical history.\nAlchemy.\nThe elemental system used in medieval alchemy was developed primarily by the anonymous authors of the Arabic works attributed to Pseudo Apollonius of Tyana. This system consisted of the four classical elements of air, earth, fire, and water, in addition to a new theory called the sulphur-mercury theory of metals, which was based on two elements: sulphur, characterizing the principle of combustibility, \"the stone which burns\"; and mercury, characterizing the principle of metallic properties. They were seen by early alchemists as idealized expressions of irreducible components of the universe and are of larger consideration within philosophical alchemy.\nThe three metallic principles\u2014sulphur to flammability or combustion, mercury to volatility and stability, and salt to solidity\u2014became the \"tria prima\" of the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus. He reasoned that Aristotle's four element theory appeared in bodies as three principles. Paracelsus saw these principles as fundamental and justified them by recourse to the description of how wood burns in fire. Mercury included the cohesive principle, so that when it left in smoke the wood fell apart. Smoke described the volatility (the mercurial principle), the heat-giving flames described flammability (sulphur), and the remnant ash described solidity (salt).\nCentral Africa.\nIn traditional Bakongo religion, the four elements are incorporated into the Kongo cosmogram. This sacred symbol depicts the physical world (\"Nseke\"), the spiritual world of the ancestors (\"Mp\u00e9mba\"), the Kal\u00fbnga line that runs between the two worlds, the sacred river (\"mb\u00fbngi\") that began as a circular void and forms a circle around the two worlds, and the path of the sun. Each element correlates to a period in the life cycle, which the Bakongo people also equate to the four cardinal directions and seasons. According to their cosmology, all living things go through this cycle.\nJapan.\nJapanese traditions use a set of elements called the (\"godai\", literally \"five great\"). These five are earth, water, fire, wind/air, and void. These came from Indian Vastu shastra philosophy and Buddhist beliefs; in addition, the classical Chinese elements (, \"wu xing\") are also prominent in Japanese culture, especially to the influential Neo-Confucianists during the medieval Edo period.\nMedieval Aristotelian philosophy.\nThe Islamic philosophers al-Kindi, Avicenna and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi followed Aristotle in connecting the four elements with the four natures heat and cold (the active force), and dryness and moisture (the recipients).\nNative American tradition.\nThe medicine wheel is a sacred symbol across many Indigenous American cultures that signifies Earth's boundary and all the knowledge of the universe. It depicts the four cardinal directions, the path of the sun, the four seasons and the four sacred medicines. Each element is also represented by a color that signifies that four races of humans.\nThe medicine wheel symbol is a modern invention dating to approximately 1972, with these descriptions and associations being a later addition. The associations with the classical elements are not grounded in traditional Indigenous teachings and the symbol has not been adopted by all Indigenous American nations.\nModern history.\nChemical element.\nThe Aristotelian tradition and medieval alchemy eventually gave rise to modern chemistry, scientific theories and new taxonomies. By the time of Antoine Lavoisier, for example, a list of elements would no longer refer to classical elements. Some modern scientists see a parallel between the classical elements and the four states of matter: solid, liquid, gas and weakly ionized plasma.\nModern science recognizes classes of elementary particles which have no substructure (or rather, particles that are not made of other particles) and composite particles having substructure (particles made of other particles).\nWestern astrology.\nWestern astrology uses the four classical elements in connection with astrological charts and horoscopes. The twelve signs of the zodiac are divided into the four elements: Fire signs are Aries, Leo and Sagittarius, Earth signs are Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn, Air signs are Gemini, Libra and Aquarius, and Water signs are Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.\nCriticism.\nThe Dutch historian of science Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis writes that the theory of the classical elements \"was bound to exercise a really harmful influence. As is now clear, Aristotle, by adopting this theory as the basis of his interpretation of nature and by never losing faith in it, took a course which promised few opportunities and many dangers for science.\" Bertrand Russell says that Aristotle's thinking became imbued with almost biblical authority in later centuries. So much so that \"Ever since the beginning of the seventeenth century, almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
